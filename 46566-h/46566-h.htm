<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br /><span class="smaller">THE BLACKMAILER</span></a></h2>


<p>Hearing the sound of lightly-falling footsteps behind
him, Captain Melun ceased his investigations
of Sir Paul Westerham's kit-bag and cautiously
turned his head.</p>

<p>As he did so, the captain experienced a painful
sensation. He felt a little cold ring of steel pressed
against his right temple, and from past experience,
both objective and subjective, he knew that a Colt
cartridge was held, so to speak, in leash within five
inches of his head.</p>

<p>It was very still on board the <i>Gigantic</i>. The
liner rose and fell easily on the long, oily Atlantic
swell of the Bay of Biscay. Moreover, there was
upon the entire vessel that peace which comes between
the post-prandial exercises, such as deck
quoits, of Atlantic passengers and the comparative
bustle which arrives with tea-time. In short, the
hour was half-past three o'clock.</p>

<p>Captain Melun for several infinitely long seconds
was offered an opportunity of enjoying the supreme
calm of the liner. But he did not entirely
revel in the moments so offered to him.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, with some relief that he heard a
distinctly pleasant, though slightly mocking, voice
break the accentuated silence and say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Don't be alarmed, Captain Melun. I mean you
no harm. I am simply psychologically interested
in your movements. The fact that I am attempting
to protect the contents of my kit-bag from
your attentions is of comparatively small importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain drew a little breath of relief, not the
less sincere because he was conscious that the
nozzle of the revolver was withdrawn from his
temple.</p>

<p>He heard the door of the state-room close softly;
then the pleasant voice spoke again, though with
a slightly harder ring in its tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up, Captain Melun,&#8221; said the voice,
&#8220;and be seated. I have a good deal to say, and it
is not my habit to talk to any man when I find him
on his knees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun rose a little unsteadily and faced
about, to find the most disconcerting eyes of Sir
Paul Westerham bent full upon him.</p>

<p>Still retaining the revolver in his hand, the baronet
seated himself upon the edge of his bunk and
then motioned to Captain Melun to sit down upon
the only available couch.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two men gazed at each
other with curiosity and interest; and it would
have been hard to find a greater contrast in physique
and physiognomy.</p>

<p>Captain Melun had an olive face set with dark,
almond-shaped eyes beneath a pair of oblique and
finely-pencilled brows; his nose was aquiline and
assertive, his mouth shrewd and mean and scarcely
hidden by a carefully-trained and very faintly-waxed
moustache. He was exceedingly tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
astonishingly spare in build. Indeed, his whole
aspect suggested a man who brooded over defeated
ends. For the rest, his dress was unmistakably
associated with that service to which he had never
been a credit and which he had left unwept, unhonoured,
and unsung.</p>

<p>Sir Paul rivalled the captain in inches. Indeed,
he must have overtopped him by half a head. He
was spare, too, as Melun was, but his was the leanness
of a man who has been worn fine by activity.
His hair was undeniably red in tint, and his face
had that pronounced ruddiness possessed only by
red-haired folk. His nose was inelegantly short
and emphasised the length of his upper lip, which
was, however, covered, as indeed were both his
face and chin, with a short, crisp auburn beard.</p>

<p>Strong though it was, his face, under the covering
of its beard, would have lacked both distinction
and power but for the amazing eyes. These, beneath
brows which were rather beetling for so
young a man, were of a shade which can only be
described as of duck's-egg green. They gave the
man an aspect of superhuman coldness and at times
an air of almost superhuman cruelty. They were
the eyes of a man who could look unmoved upon
a sea of troubles or survey with untouched heart
a panorama of undeserved suffering.</p>

<p>Sir Paul was, in fact, no uncommon man. Leaving
a wild youth behind him, he had for ten years
which followed his landing in the United States
pursued the hard and humble and most exacting
calling of miner in the West. Life he had always
held cheap, not only as it touched others, but as it
touched himself. He had learnt a hard lesson in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the school of life, and taking it hardly had become
a hard man. So inured, indeed, had he become
both to suffering and to danger that, when
at length a greedy lawyer had tracked him down,
he had at first resented bitterly and blasphemously
the fate which made him the richest man on earth.</p>

<p>For his uncle, from whom he inherited the baronetcy,
had been a rich man when he died; and for
five years his well-invested fortune had lain in the
hands of able men, slowly accumulating still greater
wealth, which a crowd of secondary relatives had
striven to prove did not belong to the vanished and
scapegrace nephew.</p>

<p>At first the fact that he was the undisputed
owner of quite as many millions as would have
justified an American plutocrat in being jealous
had annoyed the new baronet more than he could
tell.</p>

<p>Week after week the lawyer, mindful of his fees,
had pleaded with the new baronet to return to
England and enter into possession of his own.
Week after week Westerham had hesitated to return,
for, in spite of the hardships which he had
undergone, there lived with him still sufficient of
the old life to tell him that the possession of millions
would entail the labour of a social treadmill
which he not only dreaded but despised.</p>

<p>There had, however, come to him quite by
chance a motive for returning. On thinking it
over he had come to the conclusion that it is not,
after all, so bad a thing to be able to indulge a
whim. And the secret of the whim he meant to
follow lay, he knew, within the kit-bag which he
had found Captain Melun ransacking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Utterly cut off from the world as he had been,
the names which mean so much in Society in London,
Paris, Vienna, and even in New York, had
been lost to him. The faces of the great men of
those great cities were to him as a closed book.
The faces of their womenkind were as dreams
which he had long since forgotten. But there was
a dream in the kit-bag.</p>

<p>Even Westerham's roystering had not been ill-spent.
His knowledge of the world, which, after
all, means a certain cognisance of the evil that men
do, had taught him that Captain Melun was not a
man to perpetrate a common theft.</p>

<p>Long years spent in a land peopled practically
by Ishmaelites had taught him deep distrust of the
stranger&#8212;particularly distrust of the stranger who
would be friendly.</p>

<p>So, many hours had not passed on board the
<i>Gigantic</i> before the shrewd inquiries that followed
on his suspicions had laid bare before him, as far
as could be unfolded, the history of Captain Melun.</p>

<p>The captain, it seemed, moved in the best society
in London and New York; none the less, he was
not liked. There was no actual charge against him,
but there appeared to have been bound up in his
career in America a number of unpleasant episodes.
The record of the episodes was vague, but
that suspicion of them was justified lay in the fact
that whereas Captain Melun had landed in the
States poor he was leaving them enriched. And
to lend colour to this justification was the captain's
exceedingly unfortunate reputation as a card-player.</p>

<p>Now Westerham, if truth must be told, loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
play, and high play. In the old days he had not
cared for what stakes he played against men so
long as they were honest men; but now he resented
as an insult to his good sense the suggestion
that he should play, despite the resources at his
command, for high stakes against a man who, by
some subtle means, seldom, if ever, lost.</p>

<p>It was with these things in his mind&#8212;a mind
active and of great intelligence, a mind moreover
sharpened by adversity&#8212;that he looked stonily at
Captain Melun.</p>

<p>It had almost become second nature for Westerham
to draw a gun upon a man whom he had
caught apparently intent on theft. Swiftly, however,
it came to him that a man in Melun's position
was not likely to be engaged in theft. There
sprang into his brain the notion that Melun was
simply searching through his belongings with the
idea of blackmail.</p>

<p>It almost made Westerham laugh to think that
any man should attempt to blackmail him. He had
nothing to disguise, nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Indeed, as he sat easily on the edge of his bunk
looking at the dark, disconcerted face before him,
Westerham had half a mind to throw his weapon
aside and to tell Melun to go his way in peace.
Then there came to him a certain recollection, and
the blood crept into his face so that it seemed to
burn, and his sinister eyes gleamed beneath his
brows, bright and green and dangerous.</p>

<p>His control over himself was, however, perfect,
and still in the soft, smooth voice, which long absence
in the West had not robbed of its initial
and birth-given refinement, he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What did you find?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun did not even blink his heavy-lidded
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; rejoined Westerham, almost meditatively,
&#8220;you must have been here at least five minutes
before I arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said Melun, almost earnestly, &#8220;that
I found nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to say,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;nothing
which you could turn to your own good account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun smiled a sour yet demure little smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; he said evenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me,&#8221; said the baronet, just as quietly,
&#8220;to inform you that you are a liar. If you will be
good enough to turn over the bundle of socks which
you will find in the right-hand corner of the kit-bag
as it faces you now, I think you will be able to
hand me something that is of interest to us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not aware that I could,&#8221; replied Captain
Melun with a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>Westerham picked up again the six-shooter which
he had laid carelessly at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a look,&#8221; he said, and his voice was gently
persuasive.</p>

<p>Just a flicker of vindictiveness crept into Melun's
eyes, and under the suasion of firearms he turned
again to the bag.</p>

<p>After a few moments Westerham, now schooled
to infinite placidity, inquired for the second time
if he had found anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few papers,&#8221; said Captain Melun,
crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said the baronet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> &#8220;if I am not
mistaken you have found only one paper. Be kind
enough to hand it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain turned about, and with a carefully-manicured
hand offered Westerham a slip of paper
which had evidently been torn from some English
periodical.</p>

<p>Westerham took it and looked at it casually,
though the muscles on his closed jaws stood out in
a manner that was not wholly pleasant to look
upon. It was, however, with unfathomable eyes
that he surveyed the scrap of paper before him. It
revealed the portrait of a girl with an astonishingly
quiet face. Her cheeks were round and soft, and
her chin was round and soft too, but her mouth, a
little full and pronounced, was distinctly sad and
set. A pair of large dark eyes looked out upon
the world unwaveringly and serenely, if a little
sorrowfully, beneath a pair of finely-pencilled, level
brows, which formed, as it were, a little bar of
inflexible resolve. A mass of dark hair was coiled
upon the girl's head after the manner of early
Victorian heroines. It was a face at once striking
and wistful in its splendour.</p>

<p>The piece of paper had been torn with a jagged
edge across the girl's throat, so that the inscription
which would have borne her name was lacking.</p>

<p>Westerham looked up from the picture to Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; he said simply, &#8220;go everywhere and
know everybody. Therefore I feel confident that
you will be able to tell me the name of this girl.
That is all I ask you&#8212;at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun laughed and then checked his
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> &#8220;is Lady Kathleen Carfax,
the only child of the Earl of Penshurst, who is, as
even you are probably aware&#8221;&#8212;there was a covert
sneer in his tones&#8212;&#8220;Prime Minister of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; murmured Westerham, and he nodded
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Captain Melun, &#8220;and if it is of any
interest to you to know it, I propose to marry
Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>He folded the paper and placed it carefully in
his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive my being rude,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;but I should not now be on my way to England
if I had not every intention of marrying the lady
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun was a man used to being hard
hit. He was steeled against cunningly and swiftly-dealt
blows, such as he himself administered, but
this declaration of Sir Paul Westerham, that he
intended to marry the Lady Kathleen, took him
quite aback.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he exclaimed softly, and his voice had a
certain note of puzzlement and anxiety in it.
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he repeated, and again he said &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The baronet smiled a little grimly in his red
beard, but his duck's-egg green eyes were as serene
and as cold as ever.</p>

<p>The three gently ejaculated &#8220;Ohs&#8221; of the
captain had told him much. His quick brain
realised that he had dealt the captain an exceedingly
well-landed blow. Then the baronet's smile died,
for, following the train of his suspicious thoughts,
he instinctively grasped and held on to the idea
that just as Melun had been searching his kit-bag
for the purpose of blackmail, so that individual
purposed marriage with the Prime Minister's
daughter to the same end.</p>

<p>This notion disquieted him greatly.</p>

<p>It disturbed him so much that the hard eyes
hardened. Only the baronet's friends knew that
they sometimes hardened because of the softness
behind their gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Westerham's heart, indeed, rose in revolt against
the suggestion that this man, spurned of the Army,
suspected of the clubs, distrusted by every honourable
man, should for a moment presume to reach
out and touch the hand of Kathleen Carfax. Not
for such a man as Melun was the girl with the
calm yet, at the same time, troubled face, that had
looked out from the tattered picture and drawn
him back to England.</p>

<p>Westerham's brain worked as swiftly as the
brain of a woman, as do the brains of men who,
cut off from the electric-lift side of civilisation,
day by day face Nature in its true, maternal, and
therefore its feminine aspect. It was a long guess,
but a shrewd guess, and a true guess, that if Melun
had his hopes set on Lady Kathleen, the girl with
the dark hair and steadfast eyes stood in some
peril.</p>

<p>The mere thought of it quickened Westerham's
blood, and the quickening of his blood livened his
brain still more, so that he watched, almost cat-like,
the glance of Melun's eyes as they followed
the placing of the Lady Kathleen's picture in his
pocket.</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes nothing was said. Each
man knew instinctively that he must move to the
attack, but realised that a mistake at the opening
of the game might possibly spell disaster.</p>

<p>It was the baronet who broke the silence&#8212;it is
always the man who has least to fear that recovers
first.</p>

<p>Westerham had pursued a train of thought as
bold as it was unerring. It had come home to him
that Melun was not merely a blackmailer, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
prince among blackmailers. With infinite speed of
thought he followed out his idea, and came to a
conclusion which at once suggested and vindicated
his next remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never realised before, Captain Melun,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;what a pleasure it was to meet a perfectly-unqualified
villain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun raised his black eyebrows a shade
more obliquely, and his eyelids flickered. He was,
however, equal to the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; he said coolly, though he passed his
tongue along his upper lip beneath his carefully-trimmed
moustache. &#8220;Indeed? I shall be glad if
you will explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham took a deep breath and laughed almost
gaily. &#8220;I shall be charmed,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He paused a little and then continued: &#8220;No man,
except one with such a reputation as yours,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;would dream of regarding Lady Kathleen
Carfax as a possible wife unless he were so
equipped with all the arts of blackmail that he
had some reason to hope for his success.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Captain Melun had got back his
composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem,&#8221; he said casually, &#8220;to endow Lord
Penshurst with an exceedingly poor character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Westerham. &#8220;I endow you
with an exceedingly dangerous one.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause, and the two pairs of
eyes sought each other, and the heavy-lidded,
slumberous eyes of Melun flickered and faltered
beneath those of the man who had so correctly
jumped to a menacing conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am about to present to you an argument,&#8221;
continued the baronet, &#8220;which unswervingly follows
my present conception of yourself. Long
experience of this wicked world&#8212;by which I mean
that particular kind of vulture-like humanity which
preys upon better men than itself&#8212;enables me to
assume that you are without question a blackmailer,
a bad blackmailer, and a blackmailer of no common
type.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have also learnt this, that no blackmailer
can stand alone. His offence is the most cowardly
offence in the world. A blackmailer is always a
coward, and a coward is invariably afraid of isolated
action. I am therefore very certain that you
do not stand alone in this attempt to blackmail
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun's eyes left those of Westerham
and studied the white-painted panel behind the
baronet's head.</p>

<p>Sir Paul went steadily on with his pitiless and
logical argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am persuaded,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that your only
motive in leaving New York was to sail on the
same ship as myself, and, if possible, find an opportunity
of buying my silence on some point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly you think that in the discovery which
we have mutually made in the past few minutes
you have unearthed a fact which may be much to
your advantage. You are wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; Sir Paul continued, &#8220;it is I
who have unearthed a fact which may be much to
my benefit, and with your permission I will proceed
to explain to you why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Melun slowly shrugged his shoulders
and slightly bowed his head. He realised that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was the baronet's move, and did not propose to
hinder him in the making of it, inasmuch as until
he could correctly grasp Westerham's intention he
could make no counter move himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Following therefore,&#8221; continued Westerham,
&#8220;my original line of thought, I should say that
you were the headpiece, the brain-piece, of a well-planned
scheme of crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>The faint colour in Melun's face became fainter
still. Westerham knew he was pursuing the right
trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now with such men as yourself&#8212;mind, I am
not speaking so much from knowledge as from an
intuition as to what I should do myself were I
placed in similar circumstances&#8212;it is probable that
you have sufficient intelligence, not only to rob your
victims, but to rob your friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another piece of life's philosophy that roughing
it has taught me is that the robber is always
poor. I come, therefore, to the natural deduction
that you are hard up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's whole expression of face changed
suddenly. The coldness left it. The sea-green eyes
smiled with a smile that invited confidence from
the man before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Melun. &#8220;And what of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham knew that the battle was won.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Westerham continued coolly, &#8220;such a
sum as a hundred thousand pounds would not come
amiss to you. Such a sum I am prepared to pay
you&#8212;under certain conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly in his speech with the intention
of catching the very slightest exclamation
on the part of Melun; nor was he disappointed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
A quick indrawing of Melun's breath told Westerham
that he was hitting him hard.</p>

<p>All the pleasantness in Westerham's face vanished
again, and he looked at the captain with
narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I realise that in offering you such a sum,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;it will, of course, cost you something to
earn it. A man who speculates must spend his own
money to gain other people's. A criminal&#8212;you
must forgive the word, but it is necessary&#8212;who
seeks to make a great coup at the expense of others
must put up a certain amount of money to bring
it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, however, that I am offering you quite
enough to enable you to buy either the silence or
the inactivity of your fellow criminals. A hundred
thousand pounds is a good deal of money, and your
gang cannot be so large that you will not be able
to afford a sufficient sum to render them your
servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Captain Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Westerham. &#8220;Then you acknowledge
what I say to be true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Paul,&#8221; answered Melun, &#8220;you may take
my word at what you judge it is worth, but none
the less I, for my part, am prepared to take the
word of a gentleman. Do you give me your word
of honour that the offer&#8212;I take it such is meant&#8212;is
in all sincerity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is meant in all sincerity,&#8221; said the baronet,
&#8220;because I am following out my own particular
ideas, and I know that you have neither the capacity
nor yet the opportunity of saying me nay.&#8221;</p>

<p>No man was quicker than Melun to seize an advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
He saw that Westerham read him
through and through, and that acknowledgment of
his own baseness would be the surest way of obtaining
some small measure of the baronet's confidence.</p>

<p>No man lies to his doctor, and at the moment
Melun stood in the presence of a pitiless diagnosis
of his soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain Melun,&#8221; the baronet proceeded,
&#8220;I admit that you have had bad luck, but your bad
luck places you in my hands. In short, you can be
delivered up to the captain of this ship as a common
thief, or you can do as I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Melun hesitated, then he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never realised before,&#8221; he said steadily,
almost with insolence, &#8220;that the blackmailer could
be blackmailed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;such is the
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is with every confidence,&#8221; the baronet continued,
&#8220;that I make you my present offer. You
have divined my secret just as I have divined
yours; it would, however, be just as well for both
if I explained every motive of my action.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked for a moment almost
shyly out of the port-hole, which swung up and
down between sea and sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where I have been,&#8221; he said, &#8220;women are few
and far between. I never cared for any of them&#8212;until&#8212;until&#8212;I
saw this picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tapped his breast lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he continued, his voice rising
louder again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> &#8220;that I should ever have set out for
England if I had not been drawn back by this?&#8221;</p>

<p>He tapped his breast again. Then his eyes grew
wider and his nostrils distended.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he cried, with a certain tone of
irony in his voice, &#8220;that I am a poet. But I am a
poet of the open air. Do you think that I care a
glass of barbed-wire whisky for all the scented
drawing-rooms in the world? I began life, as they
call it, in England, when I was young. What do
you think I care for polo, for Hurlingham, for a
stuffy reception in some great house in town?
Nothing&#8212;nothing! Give me the open prairie land,
the tall, blue grass, the open sky, the joy of the
weary body that has ridden hard after cattle all
the day!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he continued, extending an
almost melodramatically gesticulating hand towards
the astonished captain, &#8220;that there is any
soft, silk-bound pillow in Mayfair that could appeal
to me when I could sleep under the stars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; He reached out his arms and
brought them to his sides again with a strenuous
motion, all his muscles contracted. &#8220;I have learnt,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;the lesson that life is not only real and
earnest, but that life is hard, that life is a battle&#8212;a
battle to be won!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon his strong, sinewy, brown
hands, and he clenched his fists.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going back to England to make
pleasure, but to fight&#8212;to win the girl of the picture&#8212;from
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But now, to Westerham's surprise, Melun had
turned to sneering. The baronet was a breed of
man the captain did not understand; no man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he had as yet been acquainted with loosed his heart
in this wild manner. It seemed to him that Westerham
was but a romantic child.</p>

<p>But there was no childhood, no romance, in the
bitter gaze he lifted his eyes to meet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Westerham, quietly, &#8220;for a hundred
thousand pounds I expect you to place yourself
at my disposal. For a hundred thousand pounds
I expect not only your services, but the services of
all those whom you employ. And the greatest of
these services will be silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to England as Sir Paul Westerham,
Baronet, the richest man in the world.
Thanks to the prying of the New York reporters
I have had to sail on this ship in my own name. I
did not wish it, and I have no intention of ever
being discovered in London in the same character
as I left New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham laughed a little to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;No reporters at the dock-side for me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;No triumphal entry into London. No account
of what I eat and do, and how many hours
a night I sleep. I am going back to London to do
precisely as I choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun was very quiet. He knew he had met a
stronger spirit than his own. For all the bleak
chilliness of the eyes of the man who talked to him,
he knew that he had to deal with the fierceness of a
wild animal which feels the cage opening before
him, that Westerham was seeking to evade the bars
of a social prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;In three days' time,&#8221; Westerham went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> &#8220;we
shall be in Liverpool. I shall leave the ship in such
a dress that no man will recognise me. I shall go
straight to London and put up at Walter's Hotel
in the Strand. It is a little place, where not even
journalists will look for a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; said Melun, &#8220;that if you disappear
in that manner there will be an awful outcry
over your disappearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That matters nothing,&#8221; said Westerham. &#8220;Disappear
I shall, to pursue my own ends as I choose
to follow them. For once I am going to prove
that money has the power to hide a man. Do you
agree to my bargain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because I must. The day
after you land in Liverpool I will meet you at
Walter's.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;that you
agree. Yet I doubt your word. There is something
which I have not yet fathomed. You are still
thinking of Lady Kathleen?</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie to me if you dare!&#8221; he added with brutal
emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not such a fool as to lie to you,&#8221; answered
Captain Melun. &#8220;I am still thinking of the Lady
Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you make a vast mistake,&#8221; said the baronet.</p>

<p>He rose and opened the door for Melun to pass
out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br /><span class="smaller">THE GIRL IN THE PARK</span></a></h2>


<p>On the same night the oily quality departed from
the swell. It came on to blow, and blew hard until
the <i>Gigantic</i> crossed the Mersey's turgid bar.</p>

<p>It was sufficiently rough to justify a great number
of persons remaining in their cabins, but it was
hardly sufficiently rough to excuse a two-days' absence
of Captain Melun from the poker table.</p>

<p>There were some who were fools enough to
grumble at Melun's absence, alleging against him
that he sought to rob them of that revenge which
they desired to make.</p>

<p>But while the rough weather kept Captain Melun
below it brought Sir Paul Westerham on deck.
And those maidens whose beauty was weatherproof
rejoiced in the fact that the hitherto unattainable
baronet now seemed to court friendly
advances.</p>

<p>But they, poor little dears, did not know what
Captain Melun did&#8212;their dreams of endless millions
were unspoiled by any knowledge of the little
paper which Westerham carried in his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>On the third day, however, there came a complete
right-about-face in the conduct of the two
men whose personalities had most impressed themselves
on the ship's company, for while Melun came
on deck looking sullen and morose, the baronet
pleaded a slight attack of fever and hid himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
in his state-room. Nor indeed, until with all that
serenity on the bridge and all that shouting on the
quay which goes to the berthing of a great liner,
did any of the maidens, clamorous for his presence,
look upon Westerham's face again.</p>

<p>The gangway lashed securely to the <i>Gigantic's</i>
side, the first to step aboard were the reporters,
anxious and eager-eyed, keen on finding the miner
who was now a baronet and a millionaire. They
proposed to wire his life-story up to London for
the benefit of readers beyond number. Hard upon
the reporters came the fussy relatives and friends
of passengers, and amid the general kissings and
hand-shakings on deck no one had much thought
for any particular individual beyond himself.</p>

<p>So, without arousing any comment, there stepped
from the main entrance to the saloon a tall, spare,
clean-shaven man dressed in clerical garb. Even
the fact that his face was exceedingly ruddy and
that his eyes were of a peculiar sea-green shade
aroused no comment.</p>

<p>Carrying a little bag in his hand, the apparently
athletic curate swept his way to the head of the
gangway, where his fresh and smiling face invited
confidence from the reporters who hovered there,
nervous lest the baronet should escape them.</p>

<p>One of them lifted his hat, and stepping forward,
asked the tall, youthful parson if he had seen
Sir Paul Westerham.</p>

<p>The parson smiled and said gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him two minutes ago in his state-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stampede on the part of the journalists,
and, smiling blandly to himself, Westerham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
settled his clerical hat firmly on his head and sped
down the gangway.</p>

<p>In the days he had spent below decks Westerham
had mapped out for himself a sufficiently
daring and ingenious plan of campaign to satisfy
the most exacting of romantic minds. It was, indeed,
with almost boyish zest that he entered on
the adventure, and with all the enthusiasm of an
amateur detective had paved the way for slipping
up to London, there to become a lost nonentity.</p>

<p>He knew better than to take the boat-train.
Instead, he went up to the Adelphi Hotel, where
fewer of his fellow-passengers were likely to congregate
than at the North-Western, deposited his
bag, and thereafter sauntered out to enjoy a stroll
through the crowded streets of Liverpool.</p>

<p>At the Adelphi he slept that night, proceeding
up to London on the following day.</p>

<p>He arrived at Euston about one o'clock, and
drove straight to Walter's, a small yet comfortable
hotel on the north side of the Strand.</p>

<p>Before going there, however, he had taken the
precaution to buy some passable, if ready-made,
clothes, together with a tweed cap, so that there
was left about him no trace of the clerical disguise
which he had assumed on arriving at Liverpool.</p>

<p>His presence, indeed, was sufficiently honest and
prosperous to warrant not the slightest inquiry as
to his <i>bona fides</i> at the hotel. In an hour he had
comfortably settled himself in his new and temporary
home, taking a small bedroom and a small
sitting-room on the second floor.</p>

<p>Immediately on taking the room he had written
a note to his friend, Lord Dunton, who was practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the only man in the whole of London whom
he considered he could trust.</p>

<p>Dunton called at about five o'clock, and the two
men spent a couple of hours in a quiet corner
chuckling over the vivid accounts in the various
newspapers which told of the mysterious disappearance
of the miner baronet from the <i>Gigantic</i>.</p>

<p>Every theory which could be advanced was exploited
to the full&#8212;murder, suicide, lapse of
memory, and accidents of every sort and description
were set forth to account for Sir Paul Westerham's
vanishment. There were interviews with
the captain and purser of the <i>Gigantic</i>; interviews
with a score of passengers, and, much to Westerham's
amusement, numerous bearded portraits of
himself in a miner's guise.</p>

<p>Then, over a whisky-and-soda, Westerham briefly
outlined to Dunton the adventure with Melun in his
cabin and of his voluntary disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing that troubles me,&#8221; Westerham
concluded, &#8220;is whether you will stand by and see
me through. It is practically impossible for me to
achieve what I consider necessary unless I have at
least one friend who will keep his mouth shut
tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said Dunton, earnestly, &#8220;I
assure you that if this is your whim I see no reason
why I should not do my best not only to humour
it but to help it. By Jove!&#8221; he added, &#8220;but it's
a ripping good idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>For Lord Dunton, who was very light-haired,
very blue-eyed, and very vapid, had in his composition
a great tendency to what he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> &#8220;a ripping
good lark.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the two men arranged the matter between
them.</p>

<p>They dined together very quietly in a little
restaurant in Soho, where nobody who knew Dunton
was likely to meet them, and where the
cooking, if unpretentious, was at least good.</p>

<p>Afterwards Westerham went back to Dunton's
rooms in Ryder Street, where they talked far into
the night. They sat together, indeed, until past
two o'clock, so that even the polite porter at
Walter's raised his eyebrows at Westerham with
some disapprobation when he finally returned to
his hotel.</p>

<p>Next morning Dunton called early, and together
the two men went up to the baronet's solicitors in
Lincoln's Inn. There they had a long and not
wholly placid interview with Mr. Victor Hantell, a
somewhat elderly gentleman with pronounced
views on the law and the propriety of abiding
strictly by it.</p>

<p>In answer to all his objections, however, the
baronet had one extremely awkward reply:</p>

<p>Did or did not the lawyer wish to remain entrusted
with the care of his vast estates and
fortune?</p>

<p>So after a couple of hours' talk matters were
arranged to Westerham's way of thinking.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand pounds were to be paid into
Lord Dunton's account in order that Westerham
might be able to draw such sums of money as he
required without any knowledge in any quarter of
the fact that the baronet himself was dealing with
the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Hantell, moreover, was pledged to complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and absolute secrecy, so that with the exception of
the lawyer and Dunton no one knew of Westerham's
arrival in London.</p>

<p>The only tinge of humour that was introduced
into the debate on Westerham's affairs was when,
from time to time, a sleek and grave-mannered
senior clerk entered quietly and placed on Mr.
Hantell's desk a card that bore the name of some
great London newspaper; for the newspapers had
discovered quickly enough who Sir Paul's lawyers
were. But they sought information in vain.</p>

<p>The few matters of moment that required to be
settled having been dealt with, Westerham and
Dunton went to lunch, and at lunch Westerham
unfolded his further schemes to his friend.</p>

<p>They acted upon them without delay, and that
afternoon Westerham secured more than luxurious
rooms in Bruton Street in the name of James
Robinson. It should be mentioned that at Walter's
Hotel Westerham was known by the same simple
title.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; said Westerham to his friend, laughing,
as they afterwards sat over a whisky-and-soda
at Long's, &#8220;I seem to be setting out to lead a
double life on a somewhat splendid scale. Where,
of course, it will land me, and into what difficulties
it will plunge me, naturally I cannot tell, but it is
really comforting to reflect that, no matter what
caprice I may indulge in, I have at least sufficient
money behind me to provide a complete excuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he went on a trifle more gravely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
&#8220;I rely so much upon my intuition that I feel
perfectly justified in regarding Melun with the very
gravest suspicion. If I do my country no other
service, I may at least be able to unmask what I
am certain is a gang of international criminals,
and, at the worst, I shall have plenty of fun for
my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The main reason for his peculiar mode of disappearing
Westerham kept to himself. He said
nothing to Dunton of the girl with the steadfast
eyes.</p>

<p>And there he was wrong, for the difficulties&#8212;the
very serious and dangerous difficulties&#8212;into which
he was afterwards plunged would have been far
more easily surmounted had he taken his friend
into his full confidence.</p>

<p>Melun, in obedience to his instructions, had
called at Walter's Hotel on the second day following
the arrival of the <i>Gigantic</i>, but having no use
for him then, and desiring to see a little of London
before he proceeded to investigate the mysteries of
Melun's life, Westerham told the urbane, if somewhat
sinister, captain that he did not require his
presence. Westerham, indeed, informed Melun
pretty curtly that he would send for him when he
needed him.</p>

<p>The next five days were spent by Westerham
very quietly. The best of tailors that Dunton
could recommend were hard at work building innumerable
suits for Mr. James Robinson, whose
magnificent motor car was at least a guarantee of
the soundness of his banking account.</p>

<p>When he had possessed himself of such clothes
as he required in order to live as James Robinson,
Esq., of Bruton Street, plain Mr. Robinson, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Walter's Hotel, informed the proprietor there that
he was going into the country, and for two days
Westerham lived in his new quarters.</p>

<p>Then he made excuses to the correct, soft-footed,
and soft-spoken valet with whom Dunton had provided
him, and went back to live at Walter's.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he rather preferred the existence
which he was able to follow when he wore
cheaper clothes and walked a humbler path of life.</p>

<p>It was not without distinctly good reason that he
set himself systematically to explore London&#8212;not
the London commonly known to the average sight-seer,
but the London of the obscure Londoner,&#8212;the
London of distant suburbs, the London of mean
streets, the London of the docks and slums and of
wastes of respectable spaces.</p>

<p>In the course of his peregrinations Westerham
found himself one night at about the hour of ten
wandering in a particularly ill-lit and remote corner
of Hyde Park.</p>

<p>He was walking lightly over the wet grass with
almost silent feet. Indeed, as he swung gently
forward, his mind was far away on the soft prairie
land that he seemed to have left years and years
before. So occupied was he with his thoughts that
he came near to walking into a couple engaged in a
heated controversy beneath a tree.</p>

<p>When, however, he beheld them, he came to a
sudden standstill, all his senses alive, his quick
intuition telling him he was in the presence of some
matter of moment.</p>

<p>He did not like the look of the thick-set greasy
man who faced the girl. Westerham could read a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
man's character as easily from his back as he could
from his face, and he had instantly a great distrust
of the fat man's aspect.</p>

<p>The girl he could not see, but it was with some
unaccountable notion of doing her a service, and
not with the remotest idea of eavesdropping, that
he stepped softly and silently to the further side of
a tree trunk.</p>

<p>Then he heard the girl's voice saying in low,
quiet, earnest accents:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you not let us rest? Why do you
pursue us in this way? Surely it is inhuman to
adopt these methods. You know what you want,
and you have practically the power of obtaining it.
Is it fair to drag me to a place like this and insult
me in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man mumbled something which Westerham
could not catch.</p>

<p>Then he heard the girl utter a little cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she exclaimed eagerly. &#8220;Look! I will
make you an offer. Free us from this horrible
nightmare, give me your word that you will not
persecute us further, and I will give you these.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham heard the rustle of draperies, and
was conscious that the girl reached out her hands.
The man took something from her. His head was
bent over the object, whatever it might be, long
and earnestly.</p>

<p>Then he heard a thick voice, with a distinctly
Semitic lisp, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> &#8220;They are beautiful, very beautiful.
But what are they to us? You think they
are worth a hundred thousand pounds, eh? Suppose
they are&#8212;what of that? Do you think a hundred
thousand pounds can close our lips? Do you think
a hundred thousand pounds can save your father?
Bah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man chuckled thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are very pretty baubles,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;and seeing you offer them to me, I see no reason
why I should not keep them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;Then you will be
silent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silent!&#8221; exclaimed the man, &#8220;Silent, for this
much! Not us! Why, it's ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then give them back to me,&#8221; said the girl,
quietly, with a quaver in her voice. &#8220;Give them
back to me. Would you rob me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not robbing you,&#8221; answered the man,
sullenly. &#8220;I am taking what you offered me. I
shall not give them back. It is impossible for you
to make me. You would cry out, would you?
What good would that do? Cry out, call a policeman&#8212;do
what you like&#8212;what will it mean for you
except exposure? What will it mean for your
father except ruin? Give them back? Not I! I&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But his speech ended suddenly at this point, for
Westerham, always quick to action, took quick
action now.</p>

<p>Moving round the trunk of the tree, he caught
the man deftly by the collar of his coat, kicked
his heels from under him, and brought him with
a heavy crash to the ground.</p>

<p>The man lay still.</p>

<p>In a second Westerham was on his knees beside
the prostrate figure. With swift fingers he searched
the man's clothing and found a mass of jewels
in the breast-pocket of the man's outer coat.</p>

<p>In a twinkling he had them out, and, rising to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
his feet, he held a heavy string of diamonds towards
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;permit me to befriend
you. I do not know who you are, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice trailed away into a little gasp. For
the frightened face that stared at him with starting
eyes was the face of the girl in the picture.</p>

<p>In this strange manner did Westerham meet
Lady Kathleen Carfax.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><span class="smaller">THE RED-HAIRED WOMAN</span></h2>


<p>Westerham stood still gazing stupidly at the girl
and holding out the jewels towards her.</p>

<p>When he had recovered from his great surprise
he moved a step nearer to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;permit me to insist that
you shall take these things back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the girl stretched out her hand
and took the jewels from him. She hid them quickly
in the folds of her cloak, and all the while the expression
of amaze and fear on her face did not
abate.</p>

<p>At last she pointed to the man lying beneath the
tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not killed him?&#8221; she asked, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>For answer, Westerham turned again and knelt
at the fat man's side. He inserted his hand skilfully
over the unconscious man's heart, and then
rose to his feet again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, almost with a laugh. &#8220;Just
knocked him out; that is all. He will be all right
directly, and I fancy he will be glad to walk away
without assistance. I imagine he is not a character
who would care for much fuss and attention at
this time of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Westerham drew near to the girl and
peered gravely and keenly, but at the same time
with all deference, into her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;that it will be better
for you to walk away while we are still undisturbed.
If you will allow me, I will accompany
you to the gates of the park. If I may be permitted
to say so, it is hardly fitting that a lady in
your position, carrying so much property about
with her, should be strolling around here unattended.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tones were so kind and so cheering, and
suggested such a delicate sense of humour at the
whole situation, that Lady Kathleen smiled back
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; she said, and now she almost laughed
herself, &#8220;you are a very sturdy escort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham said not another word except, &#8220;This
is the way,&#8221; and then, guiding the girl through the
trees, he reached the main path and helped Lady
Kathleen to step over the low iron railing; thence
he piloted her through a throng of quite incurious
people to Hyde Park Corner.</p>

<p>She walked beside him without saying anything
at all, apparently satisfied to be in his charge; and
she made no demur when, on reaching the street,
Westerham hailed a passing taxicab.</p>

<p>The man drew up at the kerb, and opening the
door, Westerham assisted the girl to enter.</p>

<p>Then he leant forward into the darkness of the
cab and said earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you will permit me to see you safely on
your road. Apparently one never knows what may
happen in London, and, believe me, I have no wish
you should suffer a second adventure such as the
one through which you have just passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Lady Kathleen in a scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
audible voice. &#8220;If you will see me as far as
Trafalgar Square I shall be glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giving the order &#8220;Trafalgar Square!&#8221; Westerham
entered the cab.</p>

<p>They drove in complete silence along Piccadilly,
down St. James's Street, and through Pall-Mall,
and rapidly approached the Nelson monument. As
the lights of the Grand Hotel came into view,
Westerham leaned towards the girl and said very
gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think Trafalgar Square is near enough
to your home? Had I not better tell the man
to put you down at the corner of Downing
Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl gave a quick gasp, and then a stifled
cry.</p>

<p>Westerham could see her eyes shining in the
dimly-lit little vehicle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean,&#8221; answered Westerham, &#8220;what
do I know of the fat man and the jewels and your
mission in Hyde Park&#8212;nothing. I give you my
word I know nothing at all. But I do know you
are Lady Kathleen Carfax, and that your father is
Prime Minister of England, and that, without any
high-flown sentiments, it is at least my duty to see
you reach home in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obedient to Westerham's instructions, the cabman
had pulled up at the kerb beneath the monument.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are sure,&#8221; said Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> &#8220;that you
would rather alight here, of course I must defer to
your wishes. But at least permit me to follow you
at a respectful distance down Whitehall. I cannot
tell why, but I feel uneasy about the last stages of
your journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning towards him, the girl held out her hand
impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thank you. I cannot
tell you how much I thank you. You are evidently a
gentleman. I ask you as a gentleman not to mention
to anyone in the world what you have seen
or heard to-night. Believe me,&#8221; she added with a
catch in her voice, &#8220;that to-night's doings concern
the honour of the best, and, as I think, the greatest,
man in this country. I mean my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may trust me absolutely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
give you my word of honour that not one single
word of this shall pass my lips. But may I say
something else? May I be allowed to make an
offer of help? I have money, I have many resources
at my command. I would willingly pledge
myself to serve you in any way. I should be only
too proud, too glad, to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried the girl, sharply, and with a
note almost of agony in her voice.</p>

<p>The distress in the girl's tones was so real that
Westerham made no further effort to persuade her.</p>

<p>He opened the door of the taxicab and assisted
Lady Kathleen to step out.</p>

<p>Then, having paid the cabman, he turned to her
side again.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will allow me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will at least
see you across the road,&#8221; and he made this suggestion
with some justification, for the late after-theatre
traffic was now streaming westwards.</p>

<p>At the top of Whitehall he turned, and lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
his hat, stood waiting for Lady Kathleen to take
leave of him. Once more she stretched out her
hand impulsively, and he took it in his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, in the same low, earnest
voice, &#8220;thank you again and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I am concerned,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;You may rely on my absolute silence&#8212;if only,&#8221;
he added with a little smile, &#8220;because there is
really no one in London with whom I'm on speaking
terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen nodded her head and searched
his face with her serious eyes. Then she turned
and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>As for Westerham, he ran quickly across to the
further side of the roadway that he might watch
Lady Kathleen's progress to Downing Street, for
he was still fearful that she might meet with further
molestation. He saw, however, that she
reached the corner of the famous little <i>cul-de-sac</i>
in safety, and, moreover, that she was saluted by
an apparently surprised and startled policeman.</p>

<p>As Westerham walked back to Walter's Hotel
he was in a most perplexed state of mind. Was
it possible that he had stepped suddenly into the
midst of some tragic mystery? Was it possible
that it was real and actual sorrow and horror that
had made the eyes of the girl in the picture&#8212;the
eyes of the girl who had drawn him back to England&#8212;so
wistful and so beckoning?</p>

<p>That a girl in Lady Kathleen Carfax's position
might be suffering some profound grief, or might
be the centre of some bit of distressing family history,
might well be conceived. But what should
take the daughter of the Prime Minister of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to Hyde Park after dark, and what extraordinary
combination of inappropriate events could
possibly cause her to seek the silence of such a
man as he had left insensible?</p>

<p>Melun? It was possible that he was connected
with the mystery. Westerham now remembered
the man's cynical and confident smile when he had
so unwisely boasted to him that he proposed to
marry Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>If Melun were really implicated in this business,
then the methods of his villainy must be far more
complicated than Westerham had anticipated. Only
a very extraordinary conspiracy indeed could possibly
have taken the Prime Minister's daughter into
the park at such an hour.</p>

<p>From Westerham's own personal experience
Melun was a very prince of blackmailers. Indeed,
he had not troubled to deny the accusation when
Westerham had made it. But even the nimble
imagination of Westerham had not foreseen the
possibility of blackmailing the Prime Minister, at
whose back were all the forces of the law, including
a discreet and silent and swiftly-acting Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>Westerham sat far into the night, turning all
these things over in his mind; and the more he
pondered over them the more convinced he became
that Melun must be in some way implicated, if indeed
he were not the originator of the whole
business.</p>

<p>It was, however, upon what matter Melun could
possibly blackmail Lord Penshurst that caused
Westerham the most perplexity.</p>

<p>Obviously it was not some minor question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
personal honour which involved the necessity of
maintaining some sordid and disgraceful secret,
or obviously Lord Penshurst's daughter would not
be risking her personal safety, and to a great extent
her reputation, by making such a visit to the
park.</p>

<p>No; evidently the matter involved some great
State secret, concerning which the Prime Minister
had sought the confidence and assistance of his
daughter. Yet Westerham could not altogether
understand how this might be, because he could not
conceive any matter of State which it would not be
better to trust to the Secret Service than to a young
girl.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be, the mystery embraced Lady
Kathleen; and with the single-hearted desire to
assist her, Westerham determined, whether it
pleased her or not, that he would range himself
on her side.</p>

<p>To do this, however, it would be necessary to
discover what the mystery was, and he was still
far from the solution when he fell asleep.</p>

<p>On the morrow he rose early, and sat till lunch-time
in the reading-room holding a paper before
him, but in reality setting up and then demolishing
a thousand and one theories to account for Lady
Kathleen's plight.</p>

<p>He had sent for Melun, and while he waited for
him he debated with himself as to whether or not
he should tax the captain with complicity in the
matter. Finally he decided against such a course,
seeing that an affair of such a magnitude as that
in which Lady Kathleen was entangled must of a
certainty outweigh in value even the great financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
inducements with which he had sought to attach
Melun to himself.</p>

<p>Finally Sir Paul resolved to cease his exploration
of London and begin his exploration of the
devious paths of Captain Melun, with the turnings
and twistings of which he was still unacquainted.</p>

<p>It was quite possible that for the better conduct
of his campaign against the Prime Minister
Melun might require a certain amount of ready
money, and in return for that ready money the
captain might be led into showing Westerham sufficient
of his life to enable the baronet to grasp and
understand the mystery of Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>When at last Captain Melun came up after lunch
Westerham greeted him coldly&#8212;so coldly that the
captain raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you are not in a very
good humour. Is London beginning to bore you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Paul looked at him sharply. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said,
thoughtfully, &#8220;not in the least, though I confess
that I have to some extent exhausted its ordinary
attractions. Now I propose to plunge a little
deeper into its secrets and its mysteries. In this
direction I am, of course, looking to you to help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain nodded. &#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he agreed,
&#8220;but I hope you realise that up to the present I
have had nothing but your promises of favours to
come&#8212;and times are hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer, the baronet took out his pocket-book
and counted out ten one-hundred-pound notes
upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> &#8220;should be a sufficient guarantee
of my good faith for the present. Mark you,
I have had some experience of your kind before,
and I do not propose to pay down a lump sum for
services which you may subsequently find it inconvenient
to render.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I will come to the point at once. I don't
propose to spend a thousand pounds for nothing&#8212;and
when I say nothing, I mean for the privilege
of knowing you alone. I am desirous of making
the acquaintance of your friends and colleagues at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun laughed, showing his fine teeth. &#8220;I have
not the slightest objection,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and, as a
matter of fact, you have chosen a particularly convenient
day, for it is on Wednesdays that the heads
of my business meet to discuss a few personal
matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day I will not disguise from you the fact
that the discussion will be yourself. I have made
known some details of your offer&#8212;but not all of
them, because my friends are not so gifted with
imagination as myself, and I must confess that
your proposal is regarded with considerable suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain moved aside and looked thoughtfully
out of the window for a few moments; then
he turned round on his heel sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be perfectly frank with you,&#8221; he said
with an amazingly good attempt at breezy honesty.
&#8220;All of my friends are not particularly nice people,
and if they had any idea that you were likely
to play them false, not even the consideration of
tapping your vast wealth would restrain them from
putting you out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is such a thing,&#8221; said Westerham, lightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
&#8220;as killing the goose which lays the golden
eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the captain, gravely, &#8220;but even a
supply of golden eggs may be retained at too dear
a price.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he went on with an air of gaiety,
&#8220;this is rather too serious a matter to consider to-day.
I simply intended to throw out a kindly
hint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sure you are very good,&#8221; said Westerham
with a fine sarcasm. &#8220;I had not looked for you to
be so completely considerate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;to ask you to
a meal which goes ill with your present position,
but, truth to tell, as the evening is always a busy
time with us, we find it more convenient to discuss
our plans over high tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took out his watch and looked at it thoughtfully.
&#8220;If we start now we shall be at Herne Hill
at about five o'clock&#8212;that will suit us admirably.&#8221;
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the baronet, picking up his
hat, &#8220;I am ready to go when you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the hall door Sir Paul stopped and looked
out into the street, and was in the act of hailing
a passing cab when the captain stayed his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he said, with a quiet laugh; &#8220;we take
no cabs to Herne Hill from here. You will find
it far more convenient to take a tram when there
is a possibility that your movements are being followed
with attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word he led the way down the
Embankment, and on to Westminster Bridge, where
the two men took a car to the Elephant and Castle.</p>

<p>From this point the captain took an omnibus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and twenty minutes later they were in the pretty
and innocent and homely suburb of Herne Hill.</p>

<p>Stepping ahead with quick and unhesitating
strides, Melun led the way up a long avenue, and
turned into the gate of a pleasant garden, in which
there stood a substantial red-brick house.</p>

<p>On his ringing the bell the door was opened by
a German man-servant, and a moment later they
were shown into a prettily-furnished drawing-room
of the suburban type.</p>

<p>From a seat by the fire there arose an elderly
lady dressed in decorous black silk. This was the
hostess, Mrs. Bagley. Her face was broad and flat,
and she had a pair of little black eyes that danced
and glinted. Her grey hair was neatly parted beneath
a black lace cap. Altogether she looked a
particularly respectable middle-aged British matron.
Her aspect, indeed, was so completely precise
and prim, that when he turned from shaking
hands with her, Sir Paul was almost taken aback
at the utter contrast which the other woman in the
room presented to Mrs. Bagley.</p>

<p>The other woman must in her time have been
out of the common beautiful. She was beautiful
even now, though her eyes were very tired and her
face when in repose was hard and set. Her hair
would have at once aroused suspicion that it was
dyed, for it was lustrous and brilliant as burnished
copper. But the suspicion would have been without
justification, in the same way as would have
been the notion that the very pronounced colour
on the woman's cheeks was artificial too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Estelle,&#8221; said Melun, by way of introduction,
and his heavy-lidded eyes glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
quickly from the red-haired woman to Sir Paul.
He noted with considerable satisfaction that the
baronet was evidently much struck by the beauty
of Estelle.</p>

<p>The third occupant of the room was a tall young
man of the most unpleasant appearance.</p>

<p>He had very light blue eyes, closely set together,
and a large, red, hawk-like nose. His hands were
large and red, with immense knuckles and brutal,
short, stubbed nails. Westerham took one of the
huge red hands with a little shudder. It was cold
and clammy and strong as a vice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever,&#8221; thought the baronet to himself, &#8220;I
have touched the hand of a murderer, I have
touched one now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall young man sat down by the window
and carefully watched the baronet with his narrow,
light blue eyes. The quick gaze of the elderly
matron glinted and flashed all over Westerham's
face. The captain looked at him sidelong.
The red-haired woman alone gazed at him openly
and frankly with eyes that were almost honestly
blue.</p>

<p>There was a little pause while conversation hung
fire. There was nothing for this curious collection
of human beings to talk about except the baronet
himself, and on this subject their tongues had to
be silent as long as he remained.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and a portly man
with a sallow, greasy face came quickly in. He
stood still, with his hand on the panel of the door,
and gave a short, quick gasp which caused the
captain to look at him sharply.</p>

<p>And schooled as he was against the betrayal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
any feeling, Westerham himself nearly uttered an
exclamation, for the man who had entered the
room so suddenly was the fat man out of whom he
had knocked the sense the night before.</p>

<p>The fat man closed the door behind him gently,
and came into the centre of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Paul,&#8221; said Captain Melun, &#8220;allow me to
present Mr. Bagley. Mr. Bagley is the manager of
a branch of a great bank, and acts as our financier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bagley's sallow and greasy countenance
broke into a hideously affable smile. Westerham
found himself shaking hands with the man who
held Lady Kathleen's secret.</p>

<p>The pause which followed this introduction became
so embarrassing that Mrs. Bagley suggested
that they should go in to tea; and in a cheerful
dining-room Westerham found himself looking
curiously at the collection of tea and coffee pots,
whisky decanters, bacon and eggs, and muffins and
cakes, which were spread promiscuously on the
clean white tablecloth.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on many things, but
for the most part upon the weather. When the
little party had eaten and drunk their fill the captain
rapped sharply on the table.</p>

<p>There was complete silence, in which Melun
rose, and having first closed the window he afterwards
opened the door to satisfy himself that no
one listened without.</p>

<p>He then returned to his seat at the table and
spoke quickly and in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you,&#8221; he said rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> &#8220;how I met
Sir Paul.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baronet could not resist the luxury of a
sardonic little smile.</p>

<p>Melun saw it and winced, but went boldly on
with his subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite excusable,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the richest
man on the earth to desire to indulge his whims,
and if we can assist Sir Paul to humour his, to his
own advantage and ours, then so much the better
for us all. The terms which Sir Paul has offered
are generous to a degree, while the risks we run
are slight. Sir Paul has not pressed us in any
way. He desired in return for the money he was
about to hand over to us to make the acquaintance&#8212;of
my friends. He has now met them, and I
trust that he is at least satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the present, therefore,&#8221; the captain continued,
&#8220;there remains nothing to be said and
nothing to be done. We, of course, have several
things to discuss, and I am sure that Sir Paul will
not take it amiss if we ask him to excuse us. It
is quite impossible for him to take part in our
counsels. There is no immediate hurry, but still we
must talk matters over before it is much later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham rose to his feet. Truth to tell, he
desired to shake off the dust of Herne Hill, not so
much to enable Captain Melun's extraordinary
friends to discuss their plans, but because he was
sufficiently bored to wish to leave them.</p>

<p>To Westerham's surprise, however, Mme. Estelle
rose too.</p>

<p>&#8220;My carriage is, I think, waiting for me,&#8221; she
said in an almost gentle voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> &#8220;and if Sir Paul
will allow me I will drive him back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun gave both the red-haired woman and the
baronet a distinctly ugly look. He was, indeed,
about to raise some objection when Mme. Estelle
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see you to-morrow,&#8221; she said, turning
quickly towards him.</p>

<p>Melun bit his lips, but said nothing, though he
followed her and the baronet out of the room and
saw them to the carriage, which was a well-appointed,
quiet little brougham drawn by a well-bred
bay.</p>

<p>Westerham was somewhat puzzled by all that
had taken place, but he had, at any rate, quickly
divined that Mme. Estelle stood in no particular
fear of Melun, and both for reasons of vanity and
policy he determined to show her that he himself
could, as a matter of fact, exercise some authority
over the evil-looking captain.</p>

<p>Westerham thrust his head out of the carriage
as it was driving away and said sharply to Melun,
&#8220;I shall expect you to-morrow at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>For quite a while they drove north in silence. It
was not, indeed, until they were passing through
Regent Street that Mme. Estelle turned to Westerham
and spoke the first word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive my being so blunt,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I
think you are playing an exceedingly dangerous
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What it is possible for a woman to do is possible
for me to do,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>The woman sighed. &#8220;Ah, yes, possible,&#8221; she
said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> &#8220;and yet with you and with me things are
quite different. You have nothing to gain and
everything to lose&#8212;I have nothing to lose at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drove on again in silence&#8212;a long silence,
during which Westerham turned many things over
in his mind, and the conclusion he came to was that
it would be well to have this woman for his friend.</p>

<p>They were driving past the graveyard of the St.
John's Wood Chapel when he turned to her almost
sharply and said, &#8220;Are you sure that I have nothing
to gain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle turned and looked at him quickly,
and her eyes were startled; the brilliant colour had
left her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You are
Sir Paul, aren't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Westerham, almost gently, &#8220;I'm
sorry if I startled you. Those who run great
risks always imagine that the greatest object of
every other person is to accomplish their downfall.
I assure you that no such motive prompted
me in making the bargain I have made with
Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the woman, &#8220;you can have no
aim unless it be mere idle curiosity?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham said nothing for the moment, but
five minutes later, as though he were resuming a
conversation which had been abruptly broken off,
he said, &#8220;I am not so sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage had now passed out of the Finchley
Road into a quiet <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and had drawn up
before a high wooden door let into a garden wall.</p>

<p>Westerham assisted Mme. Estelle to alight. She
asked him to ring the bell, which he did, and a
second later the garden door opened by some unseen
agency.</p>

<p>When she had stepped into the garden, Mme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Estelle beckoned to Westerham to follow her, and
he stepped into the garden and stood beside her.</p>

<p>She closed the door to, glanced over her shoulder
to see that she was not observed, and then
caught Westerham by the coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Paul,&#8221; she cried in a low voice, &#8220;you are
a young man. Do not destroy your life for a piece
of folly. Cut yourself adrift from this while there
is still time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham took her hand and looked at her
kindly. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;thank you very
much. But I am not only moved by folly to go on
with this business. Some day I may explain to
you. I do not know that I particularly care for
going on, but there is no drawing back now.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br /><span class="smaller">THE CRIME CLUB</span></a></h2>


<p>Westerham made his way back to Walter's in a
slightly happier frame of mind. He liked to see
his difficulties plain before him rather than to be
hemmed about with mysteries that he could not understand.
And difficulty seemed to be piling itself
upon difficulty.</p>

<p>Much, of course, remained to be explained. He
was not sure of the different parts which the
weirdly associated people whom he had met that
afternoon played in Melun's game. He could,
however, make a guess, and his shrewd guess was
not so wide of the mark.</p>

<p>Bagley, as he had learned from Melun, was the
smug manager of a branch of a considerable banking
firm. His wife, of course, explained herself.
The young man Crow, with the large, cruel, red
hands, was probably Melun's principal striking
force in times of trouble. The captain himself, he
imagined, furnished the brains, while Bagley supplied
the finance.</p>

<p>But what of Mme. Estelle? That she had her
part allotted to her in the strange drama unfolding
itself Westerham could not doubt. But what
part?</p>

<p>Some parts that he could conceive were almost
too unpleasant to think of. Putting the thing at
its best, he could not imagine that Mme. Estelle
acted as less than a lure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>But what tie bound her to Melun? What tie
kept her within the confines of this strange collection
of human beings?</p>

<p>For a moment Westerham's heart grew light
within him. It was possible that the tie was connected
with Captain Melun. Was she his wife?
If he could but establish that, then the captain's
boast that he would marry Lady Kathleen was vain
indeed.</p>

<p>Westerham decided to inquire.</p>

<p>He was most eager to discover the ways in
which Melun and his confederates worked. If he
had, indeed, been free to follow his course of
curiosity unfettered he would have gone steadily
forward until he had discovered the uttermost of
their wrong-doing. He was, however, from the
outset balked by the problem presented by Lady
Kathleen, and he realised at once that it was upon
the solution of this that he must set his whole
mind.</p>

<p>Sir Paul was, indeed, confronted by a very Gordian
knot of problems. He laughed a little as he
made the simile to himself, until he reflected that
he was not an Alexander armed with a sword who
could disperse the problems at one blow. His, indeed,
would be the laborious task of unravelling
them one by one; nor could he see any better way
than by beginning at the very beginning, which, so
far as he was concerned, meant a full knowledge
of Melun's intimates and surroundings.</p>

<p>He was quick to see that, with all the possibilities
offered by a great organisation of crime,
Melun must of necessity have a certain number of
hardier spirits than those represented by Bagley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Mme. Estelle, or even Crow to do his rough-and-ready
work. Westerham resolved to know these
rough-and-readier spirits at once.</p>

<p>That night he did nothing except to wander
down to Downing Street and stand for a little
while thinking over matters at the corner of Whitehall.
He stood there, indeed, for an unwise length
of time, so that at last he drew upon himself the
attention of the constable stationed on point duty.
Perceiving this Westerham turned and walked back
to his hotel, where he did his best to amuse himself
by aimlessly meandering through the pages of
various newspapers.</p>

<p>Knowing, too, that Lady Kathleen stood sufficiently
in the world's eye to merit the attention of
the Press, Westerham instinctively turned towards
those columns which deal with the doings of Society.
Nor was his search unrewarded, for before
long he came across a paragraph which set forth
that the Prime Minister and his daughter, the Lady
Kathleen Carfax, would in two days' time give a
great reception at Lord Penshurst's official residence
in Downing Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Westerham to himself, &#8220;I shall
see to what extent Melun speaks the truth. For,
unless he is a liar, I will go to that reception myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore he sat down and wrote a note to
Melun requesting him to call after lunch the next
day.</p>

<p>In due course Melun came, and Westerham proceeded
to speak to him on the lines he had mapped
out for himself the day before. Much, indeed, to
the captain's discomfort, he advanced his theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that Melun had confederates of an entirely different
type from the Bagleys and Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; said the baronet, fixing his unpleasantly
cold sea-green gaze on Melun's shifting eyes,
&#8220;it is practically useless for you to dispute my
arguments, and if you have any hope of my fulfilling
my part of the bargain you had better introduce
me to them without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun laughed. It was a habit of his to laugh
when embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; he said with a slightly bantering air,
&#8220;you are almost too swift for me. Believe me,
you are dangerously quick. It is most unwise for
a man to plunge suddenly into an acquaintance
with the various kinds of undesirable people which
it is my misfortune to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are rather touchy about their privacy,
and they are apt actively to resent intrusion. I
should leave them alone. Personally, I dislike fuss
of every description, but especially the kind of
fuss which hurts physically.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he caught a slight sneer on Westerham's
mouth and reddened a little. He reddened still
more when the baronet said shortly, &#8220;I thought
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun's composure, however, returned to him
almost instantly. &#8220;Come, come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is
foolish to be nasty to your friends. We all have
our little failings. I have mine. Yours, it seems,
is rashness; mine may be timidity. It is purely a
question of constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Constitution,&#8221; said Westerham, grimly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> &#8220;is
largely a question of degrees of force. On this occasion
I think that force will win. Please understand
me distinctly that, however rash you may
think me, however foolish my haste may appear, I
am determined to see the rest of your organisation
without further delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;So be it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we shall want a couple
of caps, and you will have to turn your collar up.
Not even the comparatively humble bowler is particularly
acceptable in Limehouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Limehouse!&#8221; exclaimed Westerham. And he
smiled a pleased little smile to himself. Events
were developing themselves in a sufficiently melodramatic
way to be entertaining. &#8220;Limehouse,&#8221;
he said again. &#8220;I was there yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun drew in his breath sharply and bared his
teeth in an unpleasant snarl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been spying?&#8221; he asked coarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't spy,&#8221; said Westerham, coldly.</p>

<p>And that was sufficient.</p>

<p>The two men ate a rather gloomy dinner in the
small hotel. Conversation lagged, for as yet they
had not much in common. Each of them, however,
from a different point of view, was soon to
have far too much in common with the other.</p>

<p>Towards eight o'clock Melun rose and suggested
that they should be going. Westerham provided
him with a cap, and having pulled their coat collars
about their ears, they climbed on board one of
the Blackwall motor omnibuses.</p>

<p>On this they travelled as far as Leman Street,
where Melun descended from the omnibus roof.
Westerham followed at his heels.</p>

<p>They then took a tram, and for what seemed to
Westerham an interminable time they travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
slowly eastward along the Commercial Road.
Presently a great white tower threw into greater
blackness the surrounding black of the murky sky.
Westerham, as the result of his recent experiences
in the East End, knew the tower to be that of
Limehouse church.</p>

<p>Here they again alighted, and Melun walked
quickly down that curious street which is known
as Limehouse Cut.</p>

<p>Gas lamps standing at long intervals threw a
very feeble and flickering light upon the small,
low-built shops which traverse its western side.
The light, however, was sufficient to show the
curious hieroglyphics which proclaimed the tenants
of those shops to be Chinese.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Limehouse Cut Melun turned
sharp to the right, and in a little space set back
from the road Westerham found himself surveying
yet another of the queer little hieroglyphic-ridden
shops. But there was a difference, for
whereas the others were low built, this was some
four storeys high. The door, too, instead of being
glass-panelled, was of solid wood, and apparently
of great strength.</p>

<p>On this Melun knocked sharply with his knuckles
nine times, the first three raps being slow, the second
three raps being slow, and the last three raps
being quick and decisive.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the door swung noiselessly
inwards, while from behind its corner appeared
the searching, slumberous eyes of a great nigger.</p>

<p>The nigger was about to let Melun pass when he
saw Westerham, and with a mighty arm barred
the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right,&#8221; said Melun, quickly.
&#8220;You don't suppose that I am fool enough to bring
a man here whom I cannot trust. Let him in at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro shuffled back and allowed Westerham
to squeeze himself into the narrow passage.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark, so the negro lifted the
lantern, the slide of which had been placed hard
against the wall, and held it on a level with Sir
Paul's head, looking at him long and narrowly.</p>

<p>Then he gave a little coughing groan and
shambled down the passage.</p>

<p>At the end of the passage the huge negro opened
a second door, which swung back upon its hinges
as easily and as swiftly as the first. Westerham
passed into the room, and with a little thump of
his heart realised, with a knowledge born of long
experience of the Pacific coast, that he was in
an opium den of quite unusual dimensions.</p>

<p>The long room ran parallel with the front of the
house, but must have been some thirty feet longer
than the front of the house itself. On either side
and at both ends there were tiers of bunks. From
three or four of them came a little red glow where
some besotted fool still sucked at his pipe.</p>

<p>No pause, however, was made here. The negro
crossed the room and opened a third door, which
admitted them into a small passage. At the end
of this a fourth door was opened, and Melun and
Westerham stepped suddenly into a blaze of light.</p>

<p>Looking quickly about him, Westerham judged
himself to be in a working-man's club. Half a dozen
men were playing pool at a dilapidated table, while
round about were little groups of men playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
dominoes or cards. Framed notices set forth
various rules, while at one end of the room
stretched a bar.</p>

<p>The negro, still with the light in his hand, stood
aside watching Melun uneasily. Westerham was
quick to observe that he had his hand on his hip-pocket.
And his smile was slightly amused and
slightly anxious as one of the players looked up
and gave a little cry, his cue falling from his hand
and his hand going quickly to his hip also.</p>

<p>But Melun was first, and the revolver which he
had whipped out covered the man's breast.</p>

<p>The man's cry aroused the instant attention of
the others, and for a few moments there was what
can only be described as a sort of hushed hubbub.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Melun in a rougher voice than
Westerham had yet heard him use. &#8220;All right.
Don't get scared. Don't worry. It is a new
chum!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham, standing very straight, stood smiling
at the astonished men before him.</p>

<p>The negro had set his lantern down, and was
passively leaning with his back against the door.</p>

<p>A little man with a bullet-head and a red face
got up from his seat at the end of the room and
came forward with short, quick, jerky steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this going to be a meeting?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Melun nodded. &#8220;A meeting,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but not
an oath. That I already have administered in part.
The new chum is silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most irregular,&#8221; grumbled the man with
the bullet-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind,&#8221; said Melun in a hectoring
voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> &#8220;it is my affair, and not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our business that you bring him here,&#8221;
mumbled several of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you bother about things which do not
concern you,&#8221; rapped out Melun, &#8220;until I have had
my say. I have said this is to be a meeting, and I
am waiting to give my explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this several men turned and dragged forward
a long trestle table, while others quickly set chairs
about it; Melun seated himself at its head, beckoning
to Westerham to seat himself at his right
hand.</p>

<p>Still smiling, Westerham looked with his oddly
disconcerting gaze along the row of faces before
him. Melun, he reflected, must have searched London
to have found such an exhibition of evil passions.</p>

<p>The men did not look at him; they looked at
Melun, warily and anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;In times past,&#8221; said Melun, shortly, &#8220;you have
found it just as well to trust to me. The shares
of any spoils we have won have always been fairly
adjusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the most part the men nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you,&#8221; Melun continued, &#8220;that at
the present time I have on hand a bigger deal than
any I have yet attempted. If it comes off it will
mean a cool quarter of a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham drew in his breath quietly; he was
learning the facts indeed. The magnitude of what
Melun must have at stake almost staggered him.
He knew well enough that if Melun spoke to these
men of a quarter of a million, the sum at which
he was really aiming must be far greater.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now, most of you,&#8221; Melun went on, &#8220;know
that to pull off a thing of this sort capital is required.
Our capital has run low. I have, however,
been fortunate in securing the interest of this gentleman,
who is more than able to furnish us with
all the money I need to settle the deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may tell you that he is not new to our kind
of work, only hitherto he has gone on his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men round the table nodded approval, and
Westerham, while he marvelled at Melun's audacity,
flushed a trifle angrily. It was unpleasant to be
tarred with the same brush as these fellows. But
he saw that he must sit it through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the very fact that this gentleman has
taken part in this sort of business before,&#8221; Melun
went on boldly, &#8220;made him suspicious of our good
faith, and he asked for an actual demonstration
that we were a working concern, and he would not
be satisfied until I had proved it to him. I should,
of course, have asked your permission to bring
him here first, but the matter is most urgent. The
fate of the whole thing may have to be settled to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and Westerham's blood began to
run quickly through his veins.</p>

<p>To-morrow night! To-morrow night the Prime
Minister and Lady Kathleen gave their great reception.</p>

<p>To-morrow night! Sir Paul wondered what
connection there might be between Downing Street
and Limehouse. Melun, however, continued to
speak in the same suave tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, as I say,&#8221; he declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> &#8220;may settle
the whole affair. Before to-morrow night I have
to show this gentleman&#8212;whose name, I may inform
you, is James Robinson&#8212;that we are really
in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson,&#8221; he cried, turning towards
Westerham, &#8220;are you satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Westerham, in a very quiet voice,
allowing himself just enough of American drawl
to catch some of the quick ears of his listeners.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the States?&#8221; asked the man who sat
next to him.</p>

<p>Westerham nodded.</p>

<p>Melun gave Westerham's interrogator a look as
though he resented any attempt at conversation;
and to prevent any further questioning he rose
abruptly from the table.</p>

<p>The rest of the men remained seated except the
bullet-headed man, who, as Melun vacated his
chair, slipped into his place. They were apparently
about to discuss other matters, and were following
the ordinary course of procedure.</p>

<p>Seeing Melun rise, the negro, who all this time
had been leaning against the door, lifted up his
lantern again and showed them out.</p>

<p>They passed through the opium den, and so into
the little passage, when, as the negro was fumbling
at the door, Westerham heard a long, piercing
scream.</p>

<p>It came again louder and shriller than before.
There was a dreadful note of fear in it. It was
the scream of a terrified girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br /><span class="smaller">DOWNING STREET</span></a></h2>


<p>Westerham whipped round on his heel towards
Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Melun shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>From Melun Westerham turned to the negro,
whose teeth were bared in a wide grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Westerham demanded of him.</p>

<p>But the negro took his cue from Melun and
merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Then there came the scream again, louder and
more terror-stricken than before. Westerham did
not hesitate.</p>

<p>Before the negro had time to utter any protest
he had snatched the lantern from his hand and
was racing up the stairs.</p>

<p>Again came the scream, and Westerham blundered
up the second flight, the negro and Melun
hard upon his heels.</p>

<p>On the second landing there was no longer any
doubt as to where the cries came from. Westerham
dashed at the door, only to find it locked. In
a second he had his shoulder against the crazy
panel, and the door went in with a crash, disclosing
a frowsy little sitting-room somewhat in disorder.
All about was spread signs of a meal. Two girls&#8212;Westerham
judged them to be young East End<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Jewesses&#8212;were huddled in a corner, while a man,
whom Westerham at once recognised as a sailor,
stood swaying drunkenly over them.</p>

<p>He had his hand at the man's collar in a moment,
and swung him heavily backwards.</p>

<p>The negro, his face quivering with passion,
blocked the doorway, knife in hand.</p>

<p>It was Westerham's turn to use firearms now,
and he covered the man with as certain and as
deadly an aim as that which had extorted the confession
of Captain Melun on the <i>Gigantic</i>.</p>

<p>The girls ceased to scream, but clung together,
crying and looking at Westerham in an appealing
way with eyes blurred with tears.</p>

<p>Melun thrust the negro aside and brushed into
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; he said to Westerham, shortly,
&#8220;this is enough to bring the whole crowd about
your ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham laughed. He had known what in
Western parlance is called a &#8220;rough house&#8221; before,
and was prepared for all emergencies. As
usual, too, when he found himself in an emergency,
he was cool and smiling to the point of insolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; he said to Melun, &#8220;that there is
a window in this room, and beyond the window is
the street. You forget, too, that one good man is
worth all that crowd you seem so much afraid of.
I am going to take these girls away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drunken sailor, who had by this time half-recovered
his senses, sat on the floor, blinking at
Westerham and cursing steadily.</p>

<p>Melun took one quick look at Westerham's unpleasantly
bright and steady gaze, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
shrugged his shoulders. But this time the shrug
indicated assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Westerham again turned to the negro. &#8220;Drop
that knife,&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me!&#8221; said the negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it!&#8221; said Westerham again.</p>

<p>And the man dropped it.</p>

<p>He turned to the shivering girls. &#8220;Come along,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;let's get out of this while there is time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising unsteadily to their feet, and still clinging
together, the girls moved towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me down closely,&#8221; said Westerham, and
then he thrust the nozzle of his six-shooter against
the negro's breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right about,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and down the stairs
before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun he ignored altogether, and the captain
brought up the rear. In this wise they went down
the stairs.</p>

<p>The hubbub, however, had attracted the attention
of the men below, and two or three of them were
now gathered together in the darkness of the passage,
swearing angrily.</p>

<p>Westerham, who had taken the lantern from the
negro, swung it aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to show you a light,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>They blinked as the lantern dazzled their eyes,
but they did not blink so much that they failed to
catch the glint of the weapon Westerham carried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dog, Melun!&#8221; cried one of them, &#8220;is this
your friend that is to help us all? If he goes on at
this rate he will land us all in gaol.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun, however, by this time saw who was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
better man, and felt that at the present pinch he
was wise to stand by Westerham.</p>

<p>So he cursed the men roundly and ordered them
back, asking them, with pleasant oaths, how long it
was since they had ceased to have faith in him.</p>

<p>To this altercation Westerham paid no heed. He
contented himself that at his direction the negro
opened the door. The girls he told to wait for him
outside.</p>

<p>On the threshold he turned about and faced the
angry men.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner you people come to recognise,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;that while I am here I shall do things in
my own way so much the better for you. I am
not in the habit of being interfered with by scum
such as yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>He purposely gave the negro a push, which sent
him rolling back into the passage; then he went
out and drew the door after him with a slam.</p>

<p>Once in the street, Melun broke into a torrent
of rebuke. Westerham was of no mind to listen
to him and cut him short. Turning to the girls,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk whichever way you have to go, and I
will follow and see that you are not molested.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls would have hung round him to thank
him, but he ordered them to walk on quickly, and
then taking Melun's arm in the grip of his hand,
he followed them till they had gained the main
road.</p>

<p>There he did not even take the trouble to nod
the girls good-bye, but bundled Melun into a tram
running westward.</p>

<p>They were alone on the top of the car, and Melun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
endeavoured to speak again, but Westerham told
him roughly to be silent.</p>

<p>He said no word, indeed, until they were back in
the hotel. The captain was beyond protesting; he
appeared dazed and cowed by the swiftness with
which Westerham had wrested his authority from
him and practically fought his way out of Limehouse.</p>

<p>In the little sitting-room, Westerham with great
precision poured out a couple of whisky-and-sodas
and handed Melun a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not understand me the better by sulking
or skulking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would suggest to
you that even if you are not one you had better
try to be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun winced, and was about to reply angrily,
when Westerham again cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;I realise that
while I am associated with you for my own ends I
shall have to close my eyes to a great many matters
not exactly permitted by the law of this country.
That contingency, however, I was from the first
prepared to face. There are, however, certain
things which you had better at once understand I
do not permit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not permit!&#8221; Melun almost yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do not permit,&#8221; repeated Westerham,
coldly. &#8220;And one of them is such a scene as I
have witnessed to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>His sea-green eyes were now blazing, and his
mouth was shut like a trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been introduced as your friend,&#8221; he continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
&#8220;and therefore I propose to visit Limehouse
whensoever I choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you cannot,&#8221; cried Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, my dear man, but I can, and, what is
more, I mean to. You had better leave that to me.
I already see that I am more qualified to deal with
those ruffians down yonder than you are. I am not
the least alarmed by their blustering, however much
you may be.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I would have you understand
clearly and without any mistake that I
will have no women fetched into that den of iniquity
on any pretext whatsoever. You understand
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun nodded feebly. He was completely crushed
and beaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henceforward, too,&#8221; Westerham continued, &#8220;I
am going to adopt a different attitude towards you.
Once, I confess, I had a few uneasy feelings that,
with what you are pleased to call your &#8216;endless
resources,&#8217; you might do me some injury. A good
many people disappear in London, and I fancied
for a little while I might become one of the lost
ones, but, heavens! it is amazing to think that I
should ever have felt the least disquiet. You and
your precious friends are cowards, every one of
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, we will leave that subject now and
proceed to another which is of more importance
and interest to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draining his whisky-and-soda, Westerham leaned
back in his chair and smoked thoughtfully for a
few minutes, keeping his gaze on the pale and
cowering Melun.</p>

<p>Then he reached out for the newspaper, in which
during the afternoon he had read that the Prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Minister was to give a reception on the morrow.
Folding it carefully so as to mark the place, Westerham
laid the paper down beside Melun and
tapped the all-important paragraph with a quick,
incisive finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would recall to your mind,&#8221; he said to the
captain, &#8220;that I explained to you on the <i>Gigantic</i>
that my sole object in returning to London was to
make the acquaintance of the girl in the picture&#8212;the
girl you informed me was the Lady Kathleen
Carfax. Now I find you, even on this short acquaintance,
such a braggart that I am inclined to
doubt everything you say. So I am going to test
your boast that you know Lady Kathleen, and that
you have the <i>entrée</i> to Lord Penshurst's house. Did
you lie to me on that matter or did you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; said Melun, with some signs of returning
spirit.</p>

<p>In his excitement he would indeed have leapt
from his chair, but Westerham gave him a little
push in the chest which sat him down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are here to listen
to what I have to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me,&#8221; he continued, after a slight
pause, &#8220;that what you said was true. In that case
I demand as part of our bargain that you should
take me to Lord Penshurst's to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun became livid. &#8220;I will never do it,&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not?&#8221; inquired Westerham with a
little laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> &#8220;Surely it was part of our agreement
that you should introduce me to all your friends.
If you fail to keep that agreement, then I shall fail
to keep mine; and I fancy that some of the authorities
will be extremely interested in what I
shall be able to tell them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun looked helplessly and almost pleadingly
at Westerham. &#8220;But what you ask now,&#8221; he complained,
&#8220;is quite impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun mumbled, and Westerham's quick mind
instinctively found the right reason for the captain's
distress. He debated whether he should
mention the Hyde Park affair of the night before.
Had Bagley told him? He was doubtful. And if
Bagley had not told then the revelation might be
awkward. He had no wish to drive Melun so hard
that he would turn and become obstinately intractable.</p>

<p>Moreover, if he said anything then he would
certainly never discover from Melun what hold he
had upon Lady Kathleen and her father. It would
be better, he reflected, to smooth matters over and
let events take their own course. In following his
method, he felt assured the opportunity of fathoming
the mystery must inevitably come to him.</p>

<p>So when he spoke next to Melun it was a little
less curtly. &#8220;You will hardly deny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
your presence in Lord Penshurst's house must be
unwelcome. Do you hesitate to take me there because
you think that in so doing I might possibly
be tarred with the same brush as yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Melun, savagely,
and there crept into his eyes an embarrassed, even
a hunted look.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I meant nothing at all except that, in spite of
everything, you must make it convenient to have
me included among the guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun appeared to think deeply for a few moments
and then nodded acquiescence. &#8220;Very
well,&#8221; he said grumpily, and closed the matter for
that night.</p>

<p>On the following evening Melun arrived at the
Walter's Hotel sleek and smiling. His face was
as smooth as his shirt-front, and his manner as
pleasant as the cut of his coat.</p>

<p>Westerham met him in the hall and nodded to
him with an almost friendly smile. Presently they
drove down to Downing Street.</p>

<p>When Lady Kathleen had entered into possession
of No. 10 as hostess she had turned the
rather dowdy old house upside down, and decorators
and upholsterers had done all they could to
make the old-fashioned building pleasant and
graceful.</p>

<p>It was now about half-past ten, and the crush
was very great. The Prime Minister, handsome
and white-bearded, stood apart with Lady Kathleen
to receive the guests.</p>

<p>As Melun pressed forward his gaze darted in all
directions as though in the endeavour to find the
eyes of friends or at least acquaintances. And
many men nodded to him and many women smiled
on him.</p>

<p>Though he had been away from England so
long, all Westerham's knowledge of great social
events came back to him, and he followed Melun
easily and unembarrassed by the scores of eyes
which looked at him with questioning and admiration.</p>

<p>For his immense height alone attracted attention,
while wherever his strange, bright, sea-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
glance fell there was left behind a little recollection
which would never be quite effaced.</p>

<p>As he skilfully edged his way nearer to the
Prime Minister, Westerham suffered a little pang
of remorse. It occurred to him that he was taking
Lady Kathleen at a somewhat unfair advantage.
He had even half a mind to draw back, fearing lest
his unlooked-for appearance might cause her an
embarrassment which might become obvious to all
beholders, but he reflected that a girl who had displayed
such courage and such coolness was more
than likely to be equal to the occasion. None the
less, he endeavoured, so far as he could, to soften
the shock of their meeting, and to this end he
looked over the heads and shoulders of the tightly-packed
people before him, seeking Lady Kathleen's
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly her wandering glance met his fixed
one, and for a second Westerham's heart softened
within him as he saw her pupils momentarily shrink
and then dilate as though with terror. But the
contraction and dilation of her pupils were so swift
that no one but an expectant observer would have
noted the change. Her face paled a little and then
flushed, and Westerham, from the long-continued
habit of studying people's emotions, realised with
distress that it was the flush of fear rather than
the flush of confusion.</p>

<p>By this time Melun had won his way to the
Prime Minister's hand, and Westerham followed
him closely. Lord Penshurst lifted his shrewd old
eyes to Westerham's face with a long, searching
gaze. And over his face there swept a sudden
change of expression. As Melun had whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
his name the old man's face had taken a hard and
almost dogged look, but instantly it softened, and
he looked at Westerham long with something akin
to wondering pity in his eyes.</p>

<p>Westerham smiled back frankly, laughing a little
to himself at the change in the Prime Minister's
expression. He was quick to see that Lord Penshurst
had evidently regarded him at first as an
enemy, as a man to be avoided, as a man introduced
by Melun for some sinister motive. Then suddenly,
from the very honesty and openness of Westerham's
face, the Premier had changed about to the
opinion that he was Melun's dupe&#8212;that he was a
new pigeon fit for the captain's plucking. For
Westerham by this time had not a shadow of a
doubt that Lord Penshurst was only too intimately
acquainted with the extent of Melun's evil doings.</p>

<p>With Lady Kathleen, however, things were
otherwise. Westerham had noted that to the other
man she had merely bowed, but to him she held
out her hand, and for a second grasped his warmly.</p>

<p>The all-observant Prime Minister glanced sidewise
at his daughter, and his mobile face changed
again in its expression to one of astonishment.
Westerham saw the dry old lips tighten in the white
beard, and was somewhat taken aback. He guessed,
and guessed rightly enough, that Lady Kathleen
had not told him of her effort to save her father's
honour.</p>

<p>So great was the crush that Westerham had no
time to say any word to Lady Kathleen&#8212;at least
not then. But as he moved away he was conscious
that the dark, shining eyes followed him with a
little look of appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>He was so certain of this that he turned his
head about and found his instinct true; so he nodded
back with a little friendly smile as though he
had known her for many years. It was a smile
which seemed to say, &#8220;Very well, I will see you
by-and-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun intercepted the smile and scowled, and
almost immediately moved back in a further endeavour
to gain Lady Kathleen's side.</p>

<p>Westerham wandered aimlessly to a doorway,
and there, following the immemorial privilege of
bored young men at a dance or a crush, leant
against the lintel and surveyed the scene before
him with slightly tolerant amusement.</p>

<p>In half an hour or so the people had thinned a
little; all the guests had made their bows, and some
of them had even taken their departure.</p>

<p>It was then that Westerham noticed Lady Kathleen
and the Prime Minister standing a little apart
conversing earnestly in whispers, and at the same
time doing their best not to attract attention.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye Westerham saw
Lady Kathleen flush once or twice and was conscious
that the Prime Minister stabbed him two or
three times with his shrewd old eyes.</p>

<p>Then Melun sauntered up to them, and succeeded
in detaching Lady Kathleen from her
father. They moved away together, and Westerham
wondered what ill-begotten scheme Melun
was furthering now. For another ten minutes,
therefore, he hung idly in the doorway till he saw
Melun come back alone and take the Prime Minister
on one side. They were conversing rapidly,
and Westerham could plainly see that Lord Penshurst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was by no means pleased. There was, indeed,
on his face an expression of cold rage such
as Westerham had never seen on any man's face
before. Melun, too, appeared a trifle disconcerted,
and this was a joy to Westerham, for he was right
in supposing that Melun had hoped to see fear
rather than anger in Lord Penshurst's face.</p>

<p>Westerham was, however, not so interested in
this conversation as he was in the finding of Lady
Kathleen, so he moved across the room and through
the doorway in search of the Premier's daughter.</p>

<p>The room beyond was crowded, and Westerham
passed on to a third room in which there were
fewer people. Still he could discern no signs of
Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>But just ahead of him he saw the dark entrance
to what apparently was a landing. He moved
towards this, and found himself suddenly face to
face with her. She was sitting almost huddled up
in a little chair at the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>As she saw him approach she lifted up both her
hands as though to thrust him away, and her face
from deadly white flushed to a bright crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried in a low tone, &#8220;let matters
rest as they are. I shook hands with you just now,
but I did not know that you had come&#8212;with that
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he is my friend?&#8221; asked Westerham,
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I doubt it?&#8221; asked Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Westerham, with a quiet little
laugh, &#8220;I admit that he appears to be, but that is
to suit my purpose and to gain my own ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; replied Westerham, quickly, &#8220;but
don't misunderstand me&#8212;my ends may be selfish,
but they are not criminal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen started violently.</p>

<p>Westerham glanced about him to see that they
were unobserved; he found that they were quite
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must speak quickly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as I know it is
impossible for you to stay here long, but please
hear me out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That night,&#8221; he nodded in the direction of the
Park, &#8220;I knew nothing. I do not know very much
now, except that I have discovered a connecting
link between Bagley and Melun. Why they persecute
you and your father I do not know; I wish I
did, for I would then, perhaps, be able to help you.
These men are knaves and cowards, and they are
also fools. I do not want to boast, but one good
man could easily defeat them. Why not tell me
what troubles you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen looked at him appealingly and
doubtfully, then she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not. I do not know who you are, or
even what your name is, and although you seem
to be Melun's friend, I feel that I might trust you;
but, oh! if you were persecuted as we are persecuted
you would trust no man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham was about to persuade her further,
but at this moment her father came quickly through
the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kathleen!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The girl started up and caught her father's arm.
The old man turned quickly towards Westerham;
his face was ablaze with passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;As for you, sir,&#8221; he cried in a low voice, &#8220;leave
my house, leave my house at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham threw out a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will only hear me, Lord Penshurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told that scoundrel Melun that I will
have no further dealing with him or any of his
crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8212;&#8221; urged Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent,&#8221; cried the Prime Minister in a voice
of suppressed fury. &#8220;Do you think that you have
not heaped sufficient dishonour on my head already?
But there is a point beyond which you
shall not go. I will not have my house and my
daughter degraded in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took all Westerham's self-control to master
himself now. It cut him like a whip to feel himself
regarded as of the same breed as Melun. But
he saw it would be utterly useless and would only
provoke a scene to argue with the bitter old man.
So, making a formal little bow to Lady Kathleen,
he left them.</p>

<p>In the outer room he found Melun; he took him
by the arm and said very quickly, &#8220;Come along,
I want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun gave him one almost quizzical look and
accompanied him without speaking.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he found it rather awkward
to say anything at all, and did not attempt to break
the silence in which Westerham drove back to the
hotel.</p>

<p>Westerham himself was baffled, and yet he had
ascertained one thing which was likely to be of
infinite use to him. He had discovered that there
was, without doubt, a definite connection between
the game which Melun was playing and Bagley's
attempt to steal Lady Kathleen's diamonds.</p>

<p>That was sufficient for the night.</p>

<p>Still his impatience, or perhaps one had better
say his desire, to get at the actual facts prompted
him to take Melun into Walter's Hotel and subject
him to a close cross-examination.</p>

<p>Melun, however, had recovered from his perturbation
of the night before, and, moreover, was apparently
intoxicated by the effect of rubbing
shoulders with the great ones of the earth at the
Prime Minister's reception. Therefore he was in
a far less tractable frame of mind than was pleasant
to Westerham. The captain, indeed, had got
back that self-possession and cool audacity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
which he had made such good use on the <i>Gigantic</i>.
Westerham realised this at once, and at the outset
dealt very gently with Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think,&#8221; he began softly, &#8220;that you
had better make a clean breast of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; answered Melun. &#8220;I have no desire
to shock you, and a man who is disturbed by
the yelling of a couple of girls is not likely to take
what I might tell him in a particularly cool manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's bright, sea-green eyes hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you,&#8221; he said in a more menacing
tone, &#8220;that if you want to indulge in villainy you
have got to keep women out of it. Now, whatever
your scheme may be, it cannot be of very
particular magnitude unless it has to do with the
Premier. I fail to see where Lady Kathleen comes
into the matter at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you do,&#8221; Melun answered, &#8220;but then
you are unacquainted with the details, and I don't
propose to enlighten you. I agreed to betray the
secrets of the prison house, or rather to let you see
how my friends work, but I did not agree to tell
you of every piece of business in which I was
engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On this occasion, I fancy,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;you will find it convenient to unburden your
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Captain Melun only laughed. &#8220;Not so,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Westerham was as near to exasperation as he
ever allowed himself to get.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't want to coerce you,&#8221; he remarked
grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You had better not try,&#8221; Melun answered.
&#8220;There is one thing which apparently you have not
taken into your calculations. You forget that Lord
Penshurst&#8212;I admit that your suspicions of a tie
between us are correct&#8212;is quite as much interested
in keeping me silent as I am in keeping silent myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham had foreseen this point, and was prepared
with an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that it might suit my
convenience to become Lord Penshurst's friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; cried Melun, angrily; &#8220;you don't
know what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Melun, softly, &#8220;that I can strike
back where it will hit you most.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instinctively Westerham clenched his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you cannot blackmail
me, and though since I met you first I knew you
were a blackmailer, I did not know you aimed so
high as to blackmail the Prime Minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a few moments before he spoke
again; when he did his voice was even and low;
but Melun did not like the ring in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; Westerham resumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> &#8220;I have seen
enough to convince me that what you are after
must be very big game indeed. What it is, of
course, I do not know, and it would simply be
idle on my part to pretend that I did. But I have
the capacity of being infinitely patient, and sooner
or later I shall find out. I will not press you because
I think that I should simply land myself into
difficulties, which would make matters harder than
they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and walked over to the door, and held
it open. &#8220;For the present,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you may
go, but if I were you I would not fail to appear
when you are sent for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun took up his hat and stick and laughed
lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It suits me very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to come when
I am bid, but possibly you may not find me quite
so pliant in the future. Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Going straight up to his room, Westerham slept
like a child till about six o'clock. He preferred to
do his clear thinking in the early morning. Now
he thought long and hard for two hours. He argued
the matter out with himself in all its respects, and
though he had determined not to take a bold course
with Melun on the previous night, he was now convinced
that the only way was to take a bold course
with Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>He had not seen Dunton among the guests at the
reception, but, of course, there could be no doubt
that Lady Kathleen was well acquainted with that
entirely charming and honest, if somewhat vacuous,
young peer.</p>

<p>It was therefore with the intention of revealing
his identity to Lady Kathleen and explaining the
whole position to her that about noon he made his
way down Whitehall and rang the queer little bell
of No. 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>As he waited on the door-step, however, he was
a little disconcerted to observe that the blinds were
drawn down, and immediately the door was opened
he instinctively knew that the house was, for his
purpose at least, empty.</p>

<p>None the less, he asked for Lady Kathleen, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to be met with the grave reply that her ladyship
had left that morning by motor car for Trant Hall,
in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Without any display of discomposure Westerham
nodded the man his thanks for the information and
retraced his steps to the hotel. The departure of
Lady Kathleen to some slight extent unsettled his
mind. He reflected that perhaps he had been a
little too hasty in his decision to tell her everything.</p>

<p>There was the possibility that she would disbelieve
him, and the possibility, moreover, that she
would tell her father; and if she told her father
there was the further possibility that the Premier
would be adamant in his refusal to disclose his
troubles. And in that case he would be absolutely
baulked. Westerham was a keen judge of character,
and he saw that if her father refused to speak
Lady Kathleen would refuse to speak too.</p>

<p>Then indeed he would be in a quandary, for he
would be entirely cut off from those whom he
wished to befriend, even if he did not excite their
active hostility.</p>

<p>Upon these reflections he instantly decided to
alter his mind, comforting himself on this score
with the dictum that it is only the dead who never
change.</p>

<p>But though he decided to withhold his identity,
he was resolved to make one last effort to induce
Lady Kathleen to confide in him.</p>

<p>With this idea he turned back, not to his hotel,
but to his rooms in Bruton Street, from which he
had been absent for so long without explanation.</p>

<p>There he was met on the threshold by the entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
immaculate and discreet servant with whom
the youthful, but worldly-wise, Lord Dunton had
provided him.</p>

<p>The man's eyes revealed nothing. He merely
bowed and waited, with that urbane silence which
characterises the best kind of English servant.</p>

<p>The man's face, indeed, expressed no surprise
even at the rather shabby clothes which Westerham
was wearing, though Westerham himself knew
well enough that he must have remarked them.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I am getting into other things,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you had better telephone round for my car.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man bowed. It was the first time that his
extraordinary new master had thought of using the
very magnificent motor car which he had casually
bought in the course of an afternoon's walk. In
about twenty minutes Westerham came out of his
room again, looking, if not altogether a different
man, at least a better-dressed one.</p>

<p>Westerham was conscious that his servant surveyed
him with approval as he offered him lunch.
He accepted it, as he was hungry; moreover, he
knew that he could reach Trant Hall well within
two hours, and he had no desire to arrive too soon.
The chauffeur, also supplied by Lord Dunton, was
the same manner of man as his valet. Westerham
appreciated the fact, but was not as thankful as he
became later, when he discovered that a silent and
discreet and civil chauffeur was a distinctly uncommon
type of human being.</p>

<p>Having made up his mind as to his immediate
course of action, Westerham thought no more about
the matter. It was not his habit to think what he
should say when he met a certain man or a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
woman. He believed in the inspiration of the moment;
and his inspiration was seldom wrong.</p>

<p>About four o'clock the chauffeur informed him
that they were nearing Trant Hall, and then it occurred
to Westerham that it might possibly be
unwise to make too bold an entry into the grounds.
In consequence he stopped at the lodge and inquired
for Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>Her ladyship, he was told, had not many minutes
before called there herself. She was believed to be
now on her way to the deer park. Having asked
where this lay, Westerham got out of the car and
proceeded on foot down the leafy avenue. At the
end of the avenue there was a high wall, in which
there was a break. A flight of stone steps led up
to the break, and these he climbed.</p>

<p>On the top he paused, being struck by the remarkable
beauty of the scene. For from the wall
the green turf sloped downwards, while before him
and on either side stretched a magnificent forest of
giant beech trees.</p>

<p>He had taken the precaution to inquire whether
it were possible for Lady Kathleen to return from
the deer park by any other route, and had received
an answer in the negative. Therefore he decided
it would be waste of time for him to go in search
of her, seeing that she must come back by the same
way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he sat down on the top of the steps,
and, lighting a cigarette, gave himself over to
patient waiting.</p>

<p>Some thirty minutes passed before he caught a
glimpse of a moving figure amid some distant trees.
The figure grew in size and in distinctness of outline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and then he saw Lady Kathleen coming slowly
towards him.</p>

<p>Her face was bent on the ground, and her whole
figure seemed for the moment old and bowed. Her
appearance, indeed, gave him a little pang of sorrow.</p>

<p>He realised that when she saw him she must
suffer some slight shock. That, however, was inevitable,
and so he sat waiting for her to raise her
head.</p>

<p>Presently, as she came nearer the wall, she lifted
up her eyes, and a little cry escaped her lips as she
saw Westerham sitting there. She stopped dead
in her walk and stood still, holding her hand against
her heart.</p>

<p>Westerham knew that she must have time to recover
before he spoke, so he merely removed his
hat and, moving forward, stood bareheaded before
her.</p>

<p>A little of her old spirit came back to her as
she looked up at him. There was almost a glimmer
of amusement in her eyes, but whatever humour
she might have felt at his appearance was drowned
in her obvious anxiety. She might well have been
angry with him, but she kept her sad composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she asked, with an appealing
gesture of her hands, &#8220;it is quite fair to torment
me in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not ask me that,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;if you did believe me to be an honest man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed her hand rather wearily across her
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; she said in a slightly shaky
voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> &#8220;exactly what to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes again to his as though to
search him through and through.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; asked Westerham, with a
smile, &#8220;have you a sufficiently good opinion of
me to grant me just a few moments to say something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems I cannot help myself,&#8221; she said, with
a pained little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen,&#8221; he answered earnestly, &#8220;you
are very much upset. I assure you that if you will
only hear me out you will not regret it&#8212;at least
you may rest assured that you will be free from
any insult or annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take me some few minutes to explain,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;and so I think it would be best for
you to sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer he took her by
the hand and led her gently to the steps. She sank
down on them with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other night,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I was
sufficiently honest to save you from an awkward
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen was about to speak, but he would
not allow it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he urged, &#8220;I did not mention it to
be thanked again. I have been more than thanked
already. I only did what any ordinary decent man
would do. I have no desire to dwell on that. Indeed,
I simply mentioned it in order that I might
convince you that I wish you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you knew that man,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;you
must have known him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham stared at Lady Kathleen with some
astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word that I did not know him
then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;even if I know him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she darted a look of suspicion at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know Bagley, and I know Melun, and I
know a man called Crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen's face blanched.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what else?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He threw out his arms. &#8220;Nothing! I swear to
you I know absolutely nothing else, except&#8212;and
that, of course, is obvious&#8212;that you and your
father go in deadly fear of all the three. Why, I
cannot tell. If you will only enlighten me a little I
may do much to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it is simply out of the
question. The secret is not mine, but my father's.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me go to Lord Penshurst,&#8221; urged
Westerham.</p>

<p>The girl started and thought for a few minutes
before she answered. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said at last,
slowly, &#8220;you must not do that. He would not
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;he would
merely regard me as one who might be termed &#8216;one
of the gang.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I assure you,&#8221; Westerham laughed, &#8220;that
I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his surprise the girl looked him straight in
the face. &#8220;I wish I felt quite sure,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Westerham flushed with almost a flush of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> &#8220;is an intolerable situation.
If you would only confide in me I would confide
in you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not what I seem. I am no mere man-about-town.
I am not one of Melun's dupes. I
am not of a certainty one of his friends&#8212;even
though I may appear to be associated with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a very different man indeed from what
I fancy you take me for. My resources are
practically limitless, and without boasting I
may say that I hold Melun in the hollow of my
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, to his surprise, Kathleen gave him the
same keen look of suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear no consequence as the result of what I
will tell you,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;but Melun declares
that you are merely an American confederate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; cried Westerham, and so
great was the sincerity of his tones that Lady
Kathleen's face softened.</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps you are not. I wish I knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands and rocked to
and fro in her distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell you who I am,&#8221; cried Westerham,
stung to desperation, &#8220;am I not right in thinking
that you would tell your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded her assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then we should be worse off than ever,&#8221;
he rejoined gloomily. &#8220;Far from being regarded
as a friend, I should be regarded as an interloper,
possibly a danger, because I knew of your father's
difficulty. Yet what the nature of that trouble is
I have not the least idea. Why not tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl leapt to her feet and looked at him with
wild eyes. &#8220;If you do know,&#8221; she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> &#8220;you
are as great a fiend as Melun to persecute me in
this way, and if you do not know&#8212;then Heaven
forbid that you ever should.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you because if I did I should be a
murderess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A murderess!&#8221; Westerham drew a step back
in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;A murderess of whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't ask,&#8221; cried Kathleen; &#8220;I should be a
murderess of not one, but many. As it is I can at
least be silent, and if needs be make the sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sacrifice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sacrifice? Ah, that I cannot tell you
now, though I cannot hide it from you always. I
fear that there is no hope. That you will have to
know in time unless&#8212;unless&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; cried the girl, and her voice trailed
away.</p>

<p>Westerham took her hands gently and with great
deference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;you allow me to help
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore her hands away from his and almost
screamed at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go! Go!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Her whole air was so distraught, she was so
obviously on the verge of a complete breakdown,
that Westerham realised it would be mere folly to
remain. His offers could only exasperate her the
more.</p>

<p>So he turned away sorrowfully. It cut him to
the heart to see her huddled there upon the steps
crying as if her heart would break. But he could
do nothing. It was with a blind rage against Melun
that he stumbled back along the avenue to his car
and curtly ordered the man to return to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>And at every yard of the way he repeated to
himself the words: &#8220;Murderess!&#8221; &#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221;
&#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221; &#8220;Murderess!&#8221;</p>

<p>On a sudden he resolved to call on Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p>Possibly she could help to solve all this sickening
mystery.</p>

<p>The words &#8220;Murderess!&#8221; &#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221; &#8220;Murderess!&#8221;
&#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221; fitted with a horrible nicety
the throbbing of the engine, and he was still muttering
to himself &#8220;Murderess!&#8221; &#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221;
&#8220;Sacrifice!&#8221; &#8220;Murderess!&#8221; when he reached the
narrow door in the wall of the house of Mme. Estelle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class="smaller">SCOTLAND YARD INTERVENES</span></a></h2>


<p>Mme. Estelle was at home, and Westerham was
immediately shown into a long, low, pretty drawing-room,
which gave on to a garden at the back
of the house.</p>

<p>Judged, indeed, from Madame's pose, and from
the gown she wore, she might have been expecting
visitors.</p>

<p>The lights were shaded so that the hard lines on
her face were softened, and in the dimness of the
pretty room she looked the really beautiful woman
she once must have been.</p>

<p>In his generous spirit&#8212;though he knew nothing
of Madame's past, and practically nothing of her
present&#8212;his heart was touched by a certain air of
loneliness the woman wore, and by the very pleasant
smile of greeting which she gave him.</p>

<p>Sir Paul was conscious that Mme. Estelle surveyed
him with a certain amount of quiet wonderment.
And it came home to him that for the first
time for many years he had been shaken out of
himself&#8212;so badly shaken out of himself that evidently
his countenance bore some traces of his unquiet
mind.</p>

<p>Madame's words of welcome were, however,
quite conventional, and bore no evidence of surprise.
&#8220;This is a most unexpected pleasure,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The pleasure, I assure you,&#8221; answered Westerham
in the same conventional strain, &#8220;is entirely
mine. I do not wish in the least to be discourteous,
but I have to tell you that I have called on business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame nodded as if she understood. &#8220;Suppose,&#8221;
she said, in a pleasant voice, &#8220;that while we
discuss business we drink tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be more than delighted,&#8221; returned Westerham,
though he was anxious to get the matter
over and go back to the quiet of his room, where
he could think without interruption.</p>

<p>So Madame rang the bell, gave her orders, and
the tea came in.</p>

<p>It was not till they were alone again and fairly
certain of not being interrupted that Westerham
went straight to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; he said, and his tone was formal&#8212;so
formal that he paused for a moment to be
amused at himself; he might have been a family
solicitor about to talk business with a difficult
client.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever they may have been to you,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;the last few days have meant much to
me. Possibly you are aware of how I made Captain
Melun's acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame pursed up her mouth and smiled. &#8220;I
can guess,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but, of course, versions
differ.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's heart gave a little bound of triumph.
After all, this woman was not wholly sunk
in admiration of the gallant captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about the versions,&#8221; he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> &#8220;we
met. Without attempting to make an <i>ex-parte</i>
statement, I may say that I practically foisted myself
upon Melun. I think I may even go so far as
to say that I compelled him to reveal himself to me
in his most unpleasant light, and also to introduce
to me various of his friends. You will, of course,
pardon my including you in that number.&#8221;</p>

<p>Making a bow that was half a mock, Madame
smiled&#8212;not altogether a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Les affaires sont les affaires,&#8221; said Madame.
&#8220;Let us be strictly businesslike. Allow me to put
the matter as I think you should have put it had
you been entirely plain. Do you&#8221;&#8212;her face grew
a little hard again&#8212;&#8220;blackmail the blackmailer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be perfectly honest,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame nodded her head up and down several
times as though she completely understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the first of my discoveries,&#8221; Westerham
continued, &#8220;was that Melun had some sort of hold
over the Prime Minister, Lord Penshurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame started.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also discovered that whatever that hold might
be, the secret involved his daughter. Then I think
by a perfectly reasonable and logical course of argument
I came to the conclusion that the secret, however
closely it might be guarded, did not reflect
one particular kind of dishonour upon Lord Penshurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame nodded again. &#8220;I presume you mean,&#8221;
she said&#8212;&#8220;I am speaking, of course, as a woman
of the world&#8212;that whatever Lord Penshurst had to
be afraid of, he was at least not terrified of any
exposure of his morals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; agreed Westerham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> &#8220;More than
that; both from his reputation and the little I have
seen of him I am sure that he is so honourable a
man that he is not guarding any secret that might
imperil his family's standing. Indeed, I am convinced
that whatever he has to keep to himself it
does not include any of the ordinary crimes and
offences of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Madame nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mme. Estelle,&#8221; Westerham continued,
speaking more sharply than before, &#8220;you may or
may not be aware that I purchased an insight into
Melun's mode of life at the price of a hundred
thousand pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame's face went first white and then red.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's the first I have heard of it,&#8221; she said,
and there was an angry quietude in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;None the less, it is so,&#8221; said Westerham.
&#8220;You know who I am; you know therefore what
my resources are. Such a sum is nothing to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; and he raised his voice so that it became
loud and very clear, &#8220;I will double that sum
if you will tell me what the secret is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lying back on her cushions, Madame stared at
him with open mouth; then she sat forward and
spoke slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you allow me to speak,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as it
were, man to man? Two hundred thousand pounds
cannot buy for me that which I desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed harshly.</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle, as though she were far away, said
dreamily, and a little wistfully. &#8220;Still, I will
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>She roused herself from her momentary abstraction
and shook her head almost fiercely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> &#8220;I cannot
help you because I do not know what the secret is,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>Westerham looked at her with his cold, bright
eyes, and saw that she spoke the truth, and he was
amazed.</p>

<p>If she did not know what the secret was, then she
could not know the price of it.</p>

<p>Should he tell her the price?</p>

<p>Melun had said nothing to him on that point,
but he could clearly see where matters were trending.
Money, he understood, would be of little
value to Melun compared to a marriage with Kathleen.</p>

<p>He started, and started to such a degree that
Madame surveyed him with open suspicion. &#8220;Sacrifice,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that what she meant?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he added to himself: &#8220;Oh, Heaven!
If that's the sacrifice, then it shall never be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outwardly, however, he only straightened his
back and made a formal little bow to the astonished
woman on the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, Madame,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you
declare that you do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments he lapsed into silence, debating
with himself whether he should drop the
bombshell into Madame's camp now, or whether
he should keep what, to this woman, would be the
coping-stone of Melun's villainy&#8212;his intention to
marry Kathleen&#8212;until such a moment when its
dramatic force would turn the scales in his favour.</p>

<p>It required almost superhuman resolution on
Westerham's part to hold this second secret to himself.
But with an effort he held his lips in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>With the silence, too, he suddenly recognised that
he had come into possession of a fact that would
prove a mighty weapon with which to deal both
with Mme. Estelle and with Melun.</p>

<p>Here in truth were wheels within wheels.</p>

<p>He felt strangely softened to this unhappy
woman, who was evidently trusting much and being
trusted little; and with his pity came a speculation
as to what extent Melun was playing fair and
square with his other confederates in blackmail.</p>

<p>He realised now that the captain was in a position
to play for his own hand, and that neither the
financing of Bagley nor the ambitions of Mme.
Estelle, nor yet the brutal violence of Crow and
his subsidiary hooligans in Limehouse were necessary
to his object.</p>

<p>With this conclusion came more complete puzzlement
than before.</p>

<p>It was the word &#8220;murderess&#8221; employed by
Kathleen which distressed him most. Facile and
swift as his imagination was, he had as yet been
unable to build up any theory which could possibly
account for the obstinate and desperate manner in
which Lord Penshurst and his daughter were
guarding their extraordinary secret.</p>

<p>So long, indeed, did Westerham stand in silence,
lost in his own thoughts, that it was with a start he
realised that Mme. Estelle was gazing at him with
wide-open, fearful eyes. He was quick to grasp
the necessity of breaking the silence.</p>

<p>And he deliberately chose to bring matters back
to a businesslike method by being excessively
brutal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> &#8220;but I came
here expecting to find a liar. I have been agreeably
disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the pause which followed the words he coldly
watched the woman wince. But the anger which
stole across her face convinced him that she had
now been speaking the truth.</p>

<p>He held out his hand. Madame rose and
took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to ask you again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
will you once more give me your word of honour
as a woman that you do not know what all this
mystery is about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle, &#8220;that Melun hopes
to obtain some advantage from Lord Penshurst;
beyond that I know nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly she cast aside her reserve and
drew a little closer to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive plain speaking on my part,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;but I am perfectly certain that you are being
dragged into some horrible disaster. I will be frank
and honest with you. I have been given to understand
that the cultivation of your acquaintance will
free us&#8212;I am speaking now for Captain Melun
and myself&#8212;from those embarrassments which
trouble us so much, but I think&#8212;I cannot tell why&#8212;that
it is unfair you should be drawn into this
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't know, I am afraid, quite what Melun
is capable of. I have seen&#8221;&#8212;here she shuddered
a little and broke off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you not listen to me,&#8221; she continued
presently, &#8220;and get clear while there is yet time?
There is no reason why your good name should be
besmirched; there is no reason&#8221;&#8212;and she faltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
in her speech&#8212;&#8220;there is no reason why you should
lose&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No reason,&#8221; said Westerham, in an even voice,
&#8220;why I should lose my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle gave a little gasping sigh and drew
away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, turning away her face, &#8220;you
are pitilessly logical.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were standing thus, Westerham looking at
Mme. Estelle with his searching gaze while her
face was turned towards the window, when the
door opened behind them.</p>

<p>The prim voice of the trim maid said, &#8220;Captain
Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham gathered himself together with a
laugh. It was rather like the star situation of a
highly-coloured melodrama.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mme. Estelle will pardon the phrase,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Speak of the devil&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; He stopped short,
shrugged his shoulders, and made a little bow towards
Melun.</p>

<p>For his part, the captain was entirely without
embarrassment, having been warned by the maid
that Westerham was with Madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he said. His look, however, was so
vicious that Westerham had some inclination to
stay and see that Mme. Estelle did not suffer physically
as the result of his call. He reflected, however,
that Mme. Estelle was evidently a brave
woman and Melun a cowardly man.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with an easy mind on this
score that he stepped forward and held out his hand
to Madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> &#8220;for an exceedingly
pleasant, agreeable hour. I hope that you
will allow me to have the pleasure of calling
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame bowed and took his hand. Her own
was clammy and wet.</p>

<p>To Melun, Westerham only nodded. The more
he dealt with this man the more he regarded him
as a lackey to be ordered here and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust,&#8221; he said, and there was an undertone
of command in his voice, &#8220;that I shall see you at
the hotel to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he gained the street, Westerham told his
chauffeur to go home; he had been cramped by
travelling in the car, and had a wish to walk. He
stepped out briskly towards St. John's Wood Road.</p>

<p>At the corner between the Red Lion Hotel and
the underground station he saw a news-boy yelling
for dear life and waving about him a fiery-coloured
placard. The wind caught it, and blowing it flat
against the lad's knees enabled Westerham to read
the contents' bill:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Extraordinary Gagging Outrage in
the West End.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There were times when Westerham suffered from
the quick intuition of a woman, and at this moment
it came home to him that this contents' bill affected
himself.</p>

<p>His second thoughts were that his first impression
was nonsense, but his third thoughts were that
it was foolish to distrust his intuition; crossing the
road, he bought a copy of the paper from the news-boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>So certain was he that he was in some way connected
with the gagging outrage, of which he as
yet knew nothing, that he opened the paper perfectly
prepared for a shock. It was well that he
had braced himself, for in heavy type on the main
page he read the following:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;An extraordinary gagging outrage was discovered
at about four o'clock this afternoon at
No. 17<span class="smcap">B</span> Bruton Street, Bond Street. The scene
was the flat of a Mr. James Robinson, a gentleman
who took a suite of these fashionable chambers less
than a week ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson, who, it is understood, has only
been in London a short time, and has since his
arrival purchased a magnificent motor car, has not
been sleeping regularly at his chambers. As a
matter of fact, our representative was given to understand
that he has been away visiting friends in
the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;He returned, however, to London at about one
o'clock to-day, and having lunched, told his valet
to send round for the car which he had not hitherto
used. He was heard to instruct the chauffeur to
drive along the Hertfordshire Road, upon which
it was concluded that he did not intend to return
till late. Up to the time of going to press nothing
has been heard of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;About four o'clock the doorkeeper, having
some message to give to Mr. Robinson's valet, went
up to the chambers and knocked at the door. Receiving
no reply, the man entered by a pass-key,
and was astonished to find the whole place in a
state of great disorder. Rushing into the dining-room,
he discovered that everything had been turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
upside down. He then proceeded to the bedroom,
where he found Mr. Robinson's valet securely
bound hand and foot and his mouth gagged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before summoning the police, the doorkeeper
took the gag out of the mouth of Charles Blyth,
the valet, and then released his hands and feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the police being summoned, the man, who
was suffering considerably from shock, stated that
shortly after Mr. Robinson had left there had come
a knock at the door. On opening it, he was confronted
by a very tall and powerful-looking man,
who, he is quite certain, was a gentleman. He was
well dressed in a lounge suit and black bowler hat,
but, to the valet's surprise and dismay, wore a
mask over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Continuing, the valet says that in less time than
it took him to make the statement, the stranger
had rushed into the flat and seized his throat in a
vice-like grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;His assailant then pushed a gag&#8212;which apparently
consists of a torn pillowcase&#8212;into his
mouth, and, throwing him to the floor, partially
stunned him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this the stranger bound him hand and
foot, subsequently lifting him bodily on to the bed,
where he left him while he ransacked the rooms
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as can be judged at present, theft was
not the motive of the stranger's extraordinary proceedings,
for not a single thing is missing from
Mr. Robinson's rooms, though every piece of paper
has been turned over and every article of clothing
evidently searched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presumably the mysterious assailant was looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for some particular object which he expected to
be there. Whether he found it or not is open to
question, and no further light can be thrown on the
matter until Mr. Robinson returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson,&#8221; said Westerham to himself,
&#8220;will return at once,&#8221; and, hailing a hansom, he
directed the man to drive as fast as he could to
Bruton Street.</p>

<p>On the way he was rather troubled over the fact
that he had called on Mme. Estelle, as it was quite
possible that by this time the police had discovered
where he had been during the afternoon,
unless his chauffeur had been more discreet than
usual.</p>

<p>At Bruton Street Westerham found his rooms
in much the same condition as the newspaper had
described.</p>

<p>The valet, pale and troubled-looking, was seated
on a chair in the dining-room, evidently fending off
question after question which was being put to him
by a couple of men whom, without much effort of
imagination, Westerham instantly recognised as detectives.</p>

<p>As he stood on the threshold, the elder and taller
of the two men left the valet and approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Mr. Robinson?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Westerham nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name, sir,&#8221; said the big man, &#8220;is Inspector
Rookley, from Scotland Yard. We were, of
course, called in by the police in Vine Street. This
is a most mysterious affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently,&#8221; said Westerham, easily. &#8220;I have
been reading about it in the evening papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it will be better,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
gravely, &#8220;if my colleague takes your valet away
while I make a few inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not at all sure that I desire any inquiries
to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley was first astounded and then suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;this is a most peculiar
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;a most
peculiar case, a most puzzling case. But, at the
same time, I cannot see, in the least, how it concerns
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure, sir,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley, with meaning,
&#8220;that the sooner I remove your valet the
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you please. As I find you in my flat,
and as apparently you want to talk, and as, moreover,
I have nothing on earth to do, I suppose I
had better talk with you. May I offer you a whisky-and-soda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, sir,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley severely, and
he beckoned to his colleague to take the astonished
valet away.</p>

<p>When they were alone, Mr. Rookley turned
sharply on Westerham and demanded in a dictatorial
voice: &#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now really,&#8221; Westerham laughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> &#8220;I should
have supposed that that was the question I should
have asked you. You, Mr. Rookley, of Scotland
Yard, as detective, should be more versed in the
wicked ways of this life than I am.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my rooms entered by a stranger, who
gags my valet, and who subsequently turns all my
effects topsy-turvy. You are summoned by the
police to catch the offender. When are you going
to catch him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley was used to what he himself called
&#8220;cool hands,&#8221; but, as he said afterwards, this was
the coolest hand he had ever met.</p>

<p>However, he was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you suppose, sir,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;we are
to make an arrest if you don't provide us with some
data to go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Data!&#8221; exclaimed Westerham. &#8220;Surely there
is plenty of data here, and I can tell you nothing
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now come, sir,&#8221; urged the detective, &#8220;you must
admit that you yourself are rather a peculiar person,
and, mind you, sir, we of the Yard are no respecters
of persons. You came here a week ago.
You apparently dropped from the skies. No one
knows who you are, and yet you have plenty of
money. You buy a big motor car, you order a lot
of new clothes, and then you disappear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham nodded. &#8220;Quite true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; continued the detective, &#8220;you reappear.
You order out the car, and scarcely is your
back turned before this business happens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my opinion is&#8212;and probably you know
more about it than I do&#8212;that the gentleman who
went through your things was looking for some
special thing. I say a &#8216;gentleman&#8217; advisedly, for
valets of the description that you have got do not
make mistakes on that score.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Mr. Rookley droned on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> &#8220;gentlemen
sometimes do wild things. I have known a
few in my time. Maybe there was some quarrel
about some lady. Maybe you have taken something
belonging to some lady which the other gentleman
thought you should not have taken. For
the moment we really do not suspect anything
more serious, though naturally we are making
inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust they will prove satisfactory,&#8221; said
Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may rest assured they will, sir,&#8221; snapped
Mr. Rookley. &#8220;We seldom fail. Of course, it is
open to us to put what construction we like upon
this matter if you do not choose to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the beginning of many big affairs in
such a comparative trifle as this. Why not, for
your own sake, and for our sakes, tell us all about
it?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to warn you that as things stand your
position is very awkward. If you refuse to give
an explanation of your movements you must expect
to be regarded with suspicion&#8212;and I assure
you that with us it is not a far cry from suspicion to
action. In fact, the consequences may be exceedingly
serious for you. There is such a thing, you
know,&#8221; added the detective, adopting a more bullying
tone, &#8220;as being arrested on suspicion. Come,
tell me, where did you sleep last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear man,&#8221; said Westerham, suavely, &#8220;I
have not the slightest intention of telling you.&#8221;</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br /><span class="smaller">THE HIGHER BURGLARY</span></a></h2>


<p>Mr. Rookley swung his heavy body to and fro on
his heels and toes, and pursed up his official mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must warn you
that you are playing an exceedingly dangerous
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I suggest,&#8221; Westerham remarked, more
bluntly than before, &#8220;that you are doing precisely
the same?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you are not keeping strictly to your
duty. You seem to be taking upon yourself a great
many things which it is not your business to do&#8212;certainly
you are assuming a great many prerogatives
that you have no right to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221; reiterated the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, my dear sir,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;sit
down and try to compose yourself, while I endeavour
to explain the precise situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; Westerham continued, emphasising the
&#8220;first&#8221; by touching his left forefinger with his
right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> &#8220;although I am not very much acquainted,
thank goodness, with criminal procedure in this
country, I am at least aware of this&#8212;that the law
of England regards every man as innocent until he
has been proved guilty. But you, under some misapprehension
of your duties, appear to assume that
I am guilty until I have proved myself innocent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, of what am I guilty? Nothing except of
absenting myself from my rooms, which it is my
innocent privilege and pleasure to do. You inquire
of my antecedents. What do they matter to you?
They are my business alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he went on, eyeing the now disconcerted
Mr. Rookley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> &#8220;in order that you may not
be too harsh in your judgments I will enlighten
your ignorance to a certain extent. I came here
on the introduction of Lord Dunton, who is a most
intimate friend. I paid six months' rent in advance.
I furnished these rooms at no small expense, and
I purchased one of the best motor cars on the
market.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I wish particularly to draw your attention
to the fact that I did not offer to pay for any of
these things by cheque. I paid for them all out of
hand by bank-note. In fact, you will see for yourself
that since I took up my abode here I must have
spent perhaps a couple of thousand pounds; all of
which I have paid out in hard cash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were these bank-notes stolen? Certainly not.
Had they been, the fact must inevitably have been
discovered. No, strange as it may seem to you, I
came by those notes quite honestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not your business to do so, but if you care
to take the trouble you are at perfect liberty to trace
them. However, to save you unnecessary labour,
I may as well tell you that those notes were paid
over to me by Lord Dunton, in return for a cheque
which I gave him. Why I chose to conduct my
business on those lines is my own affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than this I have no intention of revealing.
You are, of course, at perfect liberty to make
every inquiry you please of Lord Dunton, but I
fancy you will obtain very small satisfaction from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley, desirous of
putting on an appearance which would suggest that
he was not entirely baffled&#8212;&#8220;of course Lord Dunton
may refuse to give any information, for the
simple reason that such an explanation may be inconvenient
to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not quite follow you,&#8221; remarked Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I intended to imply,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley,
&#8220;is that your friendship may not be so welcome to
Lord Dunton as Lord Dunton's friendship is to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are very insolent, Mr. Rookley,&#8221;
said Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; answered the man from Scotland
Yard; &#8220;but I think I have some justification for
being rude. Now, although it is true that I cannot
ascertain where you slept last night, I am at any
rate acquainted with some of your movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham started. This was growing a little
more awkward than he had bargained for. It even
occurred to him that it might be foolish to withhold
too much information from Mr. Rookley. But,
on the other hand, if he revealed his identity his
troubles would be greatly increased, for it would
inevitably lead to a break with Melun and that
would double his difficulties in probing the mystery
of the Premier's secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mr. Rookley went on, with a return to
his old superiority and ease of manner; &#8220;you attended
the Premier's reception last night&#8221;&#8212;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
paused that his words might have more dramatic
force&#8212;&#8220;and you went under the auspices of Captain
Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;you seem to be
remarkably well informed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; agreed Mr. Rookley, shutting his mouth
with a snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and I know this&#8212;that
either you must be a very foolish, a very ignorant,
or a very bad young man to have had the audacity
to attend Lord Penshurst's reception under such a
guardianship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is really very kind of you to make such distinctions,&#8221;
laughed Westerham. &#8220;Only, as it
happens, there is another alternative which you
have not suggested. It is not my business to point
it out to you, but I will give you the opportunity
of discovering it for yourself. I know quite enough
of Captain Melun to prevent my pleading ignorance
or folly in the cultivation of his acquaintance; on
the other hand, if you suggest that I am apparently
enjoying his friendship because my ideas of life
are the same as his, then you are wrong again. Can
you think of any other reason for my being with
Captain Melun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; said the detective, with what was meant
to be a most significant air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> &#8220;suppose we adjourn
this conversation <i>sine die</i>. It affords me very little
pleasure, and apparently gives you uncommonly little
satisfaction. Before you go, however, I am afraid
I must add to your troubles. I assure you that I
have not the faintest notion who broke into my
rooms and who gagged my valet, any more than
I have the remotest idea what the motive could possibly
be. There were a good many things, scarf-pins
and the like, lying about all over the place, but
nothing has been stolen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the detective with deep meaning,
&#8220;but suppose they were looking for something else
quite other than articles of value&#8212;I should say of
intrinsic value. Suppose that someone had a notion
that he would like to recover something you had
no right to be possessed of; or suppose that the
person who broke in imagined that he might find
something among your papers which would be of
use to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear sir,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I do not
wish to insult you, but really you are a very poor
judge of human character. Do you suppose I
should not know if whatever I had no right to
be possessed of had gone? Do you think that if
some paper or papers which might give someone
else a hold over me had been taken I should not
also by this time be acquainted with the fact?
And in either of those cases, should I be so entirely
indifferent to the matter as I am now? No, I
assure you I think that there has been some
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Mr. Robinson,&#8221; said the detective,
with a more friendly air, &#8220;let me ask a
straight question. Do you suspect that Captain
Melun has had a hand in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Westerham, with emphasis, &#8220;I do
not. I feel certain that he has had nothing to do
with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no one else, then, whom you can possibly
conceive guilty of such an outrage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham gave himself up to a few minutes of
genuine hard thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said at last slowly; &#8220;I can think of no
one in the world who would have any object in
treating my rooms in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then surely,&#8221; cried the detective, &#8220;if it is a
mystery to you, you would like the matter cleared
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Westerham, with a smile,
&#8220;cleared up with the assistance of Mr. Rookley.
No, thank you very much for your kind offer, but
I will clear the matter up for myself. In the meantime,
as I see no reason why you should detain me,
I will not detain you. Allow me to wish you good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word he walked into his bedroom
and shut the door sharply.</p>

<p>When Westerham told Rookley that he had no
conception of the identity of his mysterious visitor
he spoke the truth; nor, cudgel his brains as he
might, could he advance any theory which satisfied
him. It seemed that the best thing he could do
was to send for Melun. The captain, he reflected,
was more acquainted with this sort of dealing than
he was, and might possibly throw some light on the
matter. So for Melun he sent.</p>

<p>The captain came with a bad grace at about eight
o'clock. He had already seen in the evening papers
various accounts of the ransacking of Westerham's
rooms.</p>

<p>Westerham began by detailing to him the conversation
with the detective, to every word of
which the captain listened with a great attention,
here and there putting in a question which quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
convinced Sir Paul that Melun knew nothing of
the affair.</p>

<p>However, he was determined to see what Melun
would say if he asked him point blank whether he
had been playing the burglar.</p>

<p>Upon the question being put to him, Melun
laughed quite easily and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;once bitten, twice
shy. My attempt to burgle you on the <i>Gigantic</i>
was not so successful as to tempt me to repeat the
performance. Besides, I am a fairly good judge
of my fellow-men, and I have given up all hope
of discovering anything in your past or your present
which would lead me to the delectable state of
being able to dictate to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;that is at least
frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am learning,&#8221; returned Melun, &#8220;that it is
scarcely worth while to be anything else with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you again,&#8221; said Westerham. &#8220;And
now suppose I ask you whether you can throw any
light on the subject?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Melun, &#8220;you are asking a really
sensible question. I can. What is more, I think I
can completely clear up the mystery for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did have a hand in it, after all?&#8221; cried
Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I had a hand in it; but I took no part
in the actual burgling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Paul stared at him in amazement. &#8220;What
do you mean?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; said Melun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> &#8220;what was the description
of the mysterious stranger given by your
valet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very tall, very thin, with reddish hair and
reddish moustache, and, so far as he could see
through the mask on his face, grey eyes. His
hands, as Blyth had good reason to notice, were
very large and sunburnt, with uncommonly well-kept
nails.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun nodded his head. &#8220;Good,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
description tallies exactly with the gentleman I
suspected of having been here this afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have noticed,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that
one of the men most in evidence at Downing Street
last night was the Premier's private secretary,
the Hon. Claude Hilden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Westerham, eagerly, &#8220;what of
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He burgled your rooms,&#8221; said Melun, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Westerham jumped out of his chair
and stood over Melun. &#8220;What do you mean?
Why, it is impossible. If he did that it must have
been by Lord Penshurst's orders, and what, in the
name of Heaven, could they have expected to find
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly what Hilden came to find&#8212;what he
did find, and what he took away with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the name of Heaven, what?&#8221; asked Westerham,
to whom things were becoming a little too
complicated for him to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Hilden found,&#8221; said Melun, slowly and
precisely, &#8220;were Lady Kathleen's diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen's diamonds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Melun, smiling as though with
intense relish of an infinitely fine jest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> &#8220;Lady
Kathleen's diamonds.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were missed shortly after your departure,
and you were at once suspected of being the author
of the theft. And therefore Lord Penshurst,
knowing that Bagley had made one attempt before,
and that I was connected with Bagley, at first suspected
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, at about two in the morning, Hilden
came around to my rooms with the Premier. They
roused me from sleep and taxed me with the theft,
Lord Penshurst threatening that if I did not give
them up he would certainly not accede to the other
terms which I am asking of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him quite frankly that I did not take
them but that I strongly suspected you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You scoundrel!&#8221; cried Westerham.</p>

<p>In his sudden rage he would have seized Melun
by the throat; but Melun, whom Westerham had
never seen more calm and self-possessed, pushed
his hand aside and said, &#8220;Softly, softly! you had
better hear me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told them,&#8221; continued Melun, &#8220;that it would
be folly to rouse you as they had aroused me. In
fact, I told them that you were a strong man armed&#8212;that
any attack made on you or your rooms in
the small hours would inevitably lead to one of
them being damaged, which would only result in
awkward police-court proceedings and painful
revelations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You scoundrel! You scoundrel!&#8221; cried Westerham
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, my dear fellow; hear me out,&#8221;
pleaded Melun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> &#8220;You may consider that you have
played the game with me, but that is not my own
view of things. It was necessary to teach you a
lesson. In your nice, strong, masterful way you
were under the impression that you had to deal
with a pack of cowards and curs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have,&#8221; said Westerham, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps; but one of them is not quite so impotent
as you judged him, and if you reflect a
moment you will see, at any rate, that you are at
present in a rather awkward predicament. However,
to get on with my tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had you watched this morning, and as soon
as you left your rooms I slipped in here with the
diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said you had not taken them,&#8221; said
Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did, but I took them none the less. I got
rid of your man for a minute on some pretext, and
just jammed them into the pocket of the coat you
had worn the night before. Then I at once communicated
with Downing Street. I could not tell
them where the diamonds actually were, for that
would have given me away, but I knew that Lord
Penshurst and Hilden were sufficiently desperate
to turn your place upside down to find them. They
did find them, for Hilden telephoned the fact to
me half an hour before you sent for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Westerham, and held up
his hand for silence. He wished to think. Matters
were becoming more and more difficult to understand.
Lord Penshurst went in dread of Melun&#8212;so
great a dread that he even had to confide in his
nephew and his private secretary when Melun
pressed him too hard. It was evident, too, that
Melun's grip of the Premier must be of the most
remorseless kind, or such a man as Lord Penshurst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
would never stoop to countenance such deeds on
Melun's part.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but the whole affair assumed
a far more sinister aspect when Westerham
reflected that Lady Kathleen must of necessity be
acquainted with Lord Penshurst's expedition in
the small hours, and of her cousin's burglarious
exploits in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; groaned Westerham to himself,
&#8220;she did not trust me. No wonder! No wonder!
Oh, the shame of it! This is the hardest part of
all&#8212;to be suspected, and to be suspected of such a
mean and dastardly thing as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; he cried aloud, &#8220;but for the
fact that I should be hung for it, which would unfortunately
spoil my chances in certain directions,
I think I could shoot you on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Melun, &#8220;but I feel safe in the
knowledge that you won't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell you what I will do,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;and I have every justification for doing it&#8212;I will
go back on my agreement with you here and now.
In half an hour I will be in Downing Street
and expose the whole thing. Yes, by Heavens!
And if Lord Penshurst won't move in the matter
himself, then I will see to it that you are prosecuted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won't,&#8221; said Melun. &#8220;The question
really involved is a matter of many men's lives,
and one man's life, even yours, will not stand in
the way of this secret being kept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst is no murderer, even though
you may be,&#8221; cried Westerham, indignantly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, my dear sir, perhaps not; but, at
the same time, the situation is such that he cannot
possible prosecute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; thundered Westerham,
again laying his hand roughly on Melun's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; Melun answered, shaking himself
free, &#8220;but that is my business&#8212;and Lord Penshurst's
business.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Poor little Lady Kathleen sobbed till she could
sob no more. Then she lifted her head wearily,
mopped her swollen eyes, and, gathering herself
together, walked slowly back to the Hall.</p>

<p>She went at once to her father's room, to find
the Premier in a scarcely less pitiable frame of
mind than she was in herself.</p>

<p>The old man was sitting at his desk, his head
buried in his hands, though the table was littered
with papers requiring urgent attention.</p>

<p>Kathleen walked up behind him, and, placing
one of her hands on his head, stroked his hair
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor father!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven help us, my dear!&#8221; said Lord Penshurst,
and he stood up and took his daughter in
his arms, holding her almost as though he were
afraid she might be taken from him.</p>

<p>After a little while he became calmer, and began
to speak of the dreadful thing which weighed so
upon both their spirits.</p>

<p>But even while he spoke of it he looked cautiously
about, as though he were fearful that other
ears might be listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, little girl,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> &#8220;that your
very kindly estimate of the red-headed man Robinson
was entirely wrong. He didn't look like a
scoundrel, but he is one. He is not even a scoundrel
of Melun's description. Upon my soul, I think I
prefer the blackmailer to the mere thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; asked Kathleen, searching her
father's face, &#8220;that, after all, this is not some of
Melun's work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it be?&#8221; returned her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know, I am sure,&#8221; said Kathleen,
doubtfully, &#8220;except that I have a sort of feeling
that it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked her father.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Lady Kathleen told him
of her meeting with Bagley in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear! my dear!&#8221; cried her father,
taking her in his arms again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> &#8220;How many more
sacrifices are you prepared to make for me? If
I had not confided in you I do not know what I
should have done. I assure you that it is only
because I dread the awful consequences that would
come if my secret were discovered that has prevented
me from taking my life. But, as you know,
the shedding of my blood would mean the shedding
of blood all over the world. Sometimes I
think the dread of it is driving me out of my
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there does not seem to be any hope of
getting the thing back&#8212;no hope of it at all. By
George! I wish we were back in the good old days.
Then I could put that Melun on the rack. I'd get
the secret out of him somehow.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is too slippery. I even made arrangements
to have him watched, but he beats our men
all the time. He is here to-day and gone to-morrow.
He appears and he vanishes&#8212;Heaven
only knows how.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, to add to our perplexities, we have
got this red-haired giant, who seems to be even
more unscrupulous than Melun. Certainly he is
more bold. To my way of thinking, it was only
a bold stroke to win your confidence that he dealt
with Bagley as he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father!&#8221; cried Kathleen, &#8220;I cannot believe
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, my dear. Do you suppose that a
man who is hand in glove with Melun comes across
you and Bagley in the Park by accident? Why,
it is one chance against a hundred million.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But still it is a chance,&#8221; urged Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear little girl,&#8221; said the Premier, gently,
while he patted her cheek, &#8220;I am afraid that you
are of a very trusting disposition, though that has
certainly been to the advantage of your poor old
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Depend on it, he was
there by arrangement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, how otherwise should he know who
you were? And you say he suggested that he
should drive you back to Downing Street?</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad! it almost makes one admire the man to
think of his cool cheek. To drive you back to
Downing Street indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, father, in spite of it all, I really believe
the man's honest. You see, you cut me short.
I have something else to tell you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst eyed Kathleen uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; he asked, with a sad little
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Lady Kathleen, and for a moment
she felt unaccountably nervous and shy, &#8220;he was
here this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; roared the Premier; &#8220;he was here
this afternoon? Why did you not tell me? I
would have had the fellow flogged out of the
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, father, gently,&#8221; urged Lady Kathleen,
&#8220;aren't you speaking rather loud?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I am,&#8221; said Lord Penshurst, bitterly.
&#8220;But tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very few words Lady Kathleen outlined
her interview with Westerham in the Deer Park.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, father,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;I almost
believe he was speaking the truth when he said
that he was quite different from the man we believed
him to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish, my dear,&#8221; snapped the Premier, &#8220;he
is only a gentlemanly scoundrel&#8212;that is all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how long we shall be able to keep
Hilden in ignorance of what is really the matter,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;The dear chap has behaved
splendidly&#8212;did everything I asked him without a
murmur, even to the extent of burglary this afternoon.
By the way, he has got your diamonds
back. He has just 'phoned me from Downing
Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let them go! Let them go!&#8221; cried Lady
Kathleen, with intense weariness. &#8220;Their presence
seems only to make matters worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw herself into her father's
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father, father!&#8221; she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> &#8220;Let us do
everything we can. Don't let us give up hope.
We have still got a fortnight left in which to get
that dreadful secret back. Don't let us give up
hope. I would rather disguise myself and go out
and search for it than have to endure what it
means if we fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't cry, my dear. Don't cry. Believe me,
I am doing everything I possibly can without giving
anything away. But already it seems to me&#8212;perhaps
I only imagine things&#8212;that the servants
and people suspect that something is wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why we have got to be brave and
look cheerful. I know it will be dreadful for you
to have to look after the house party&#8212;and the
people come to-morrow. Still, it cannot be helped.
We have got to go through with it, but after the
dance we will go back at once, and then I assure
you that if it costs me my life I will make that
Melun disgorge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen smiled at her father through her tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear old fire-eater,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I really
believe you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter,&#8221; the Premier said, &#8220;there has
never been a murderer in this family to my knowledge;
but I swear to you that if I have to settle
the scoundrel myself you shall not marry Melun.
Heavens! The price of silence is too big altogether.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br /><span class="smaller">SIR PAUL IN PERIL</span></a></h2>


<p>It was all very well for Melun to tell Westerham
that he was a strong man armed. But was he?</p>

<p>Westerham pondered over this problem with a
puzzled frown. In spite of the checks he had met
with, he still felt himself to be, as Melun had said,
a strong man. And when he came to a tight corner
he was armed for the struggle, and had less fear
of things than had Melun.</p>

<p>At times also it seemed as if his ingenuity was
greater than the captain's. But, for all that, did
he really hold the upper hand? As he impartially
summed the matter up for himself it seemed to
him that he did not.</p>

<p>On the <i>Gigantic</i> he had laughed that Melun
should hope to find in his possession anything to
make him an easy prey to blackmail. Yet here he
was, a prey to the worst blackmail of all&#8212;a species
of blackmail of the heart. On every hand, and at
every turn, no matter in what direction he might
strike out, he was more than met and baffled by
the one dominant fact that the faintest breath of
publicity would inevitably lose him Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>So great, however, and so entirely unselfish was
his love for the Premier's daughter, that he would
have faced even that loss bravely could it have
brought any peace to the hunted girl's mind. But
he realised that to relinquish his claims would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
immediately to throw her into the arms of Melun.
Westerham shuddered when he thought of that.</p>

<p>No, crippled and cramped though he was, he
must certainly go on&#8212;go on in the blind hope that
he could find something which would enable him
to deal Melun a blow from which he could not recover.</p>

<p>This, however, on further thought, seemed a
rather <i>laissez faire</i> policy to follow. It was ridiculous
to think that, in spite of his handicap, he
should be beaten and bested at every turn by such
a man as Melun.</p>

<p>For fully an hour, therefore, after the captain
had left him, Westerham sat, pencil in hand,
mapping out plan after plan of campaign. But all
of them, as he pored over their possibilities, seemed
to avail him nothing, and at last, when well nigh in
despair, he tore up into minute fragments the various
propositions he had formulated.</p>

<p>Then it suddenly dawned on him that if he could
only prove, as he strongly suspected, that Melun
was by no means dealing honestly with his fellow
criminals, he would be able by a little astute management
to turn all the organisation which Melun
had at his disposal against the captain himself.</p>

<p>Westerham's bright gaze brightened and his
smile broadened. With an almost boyish delight
he immediately set to work to devise a scheme
whereby he could turn the tables on his enemy.</p>

<p>There was very little time to be lost, and to his
joy Westerham remembered that the day was
Thursday, the day on the evening of which Melun's
various friends met at the pseudo working-man's
club at Limehouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately he resolved that he would go there
that very night.</p>

<p>Rough men had no terrors for him; during his
life in the West he had dealt with rougher men
than Melun had ever been called on to handle. He
laughed as he thought of the possibilities of dominating
such a collection of scoundrels as he had
seen on his first visit to &#8220;The Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he bethought him of Mr. Rookley, and he
reflected that if the mills of Scotland Yard, like the
mills of God, ground exceedingly slowly, they
ground uncommonly fine.</p>

<p>It may be an easy thing to detect that one is
shadowed by a large man with large boots. But,
none the less, it is sufficiently disconcerting to find
that the large boots follow one's footsteps persistently
and doggedly. Scotland Yard wears down a
man by sheer weight.</p>

<p>Westerham knew, too, that he had so aroused
the interest of the authorities that they would do
their best to watch his every movement. Nor was
he wrong.</p>

<p>He realised, therefore, that it would be folly for
him to proceed straight from Bruton Street to the
East End. Never in his life had he feared any
man, nor had he ever before been compelled to face
the contingency of throwing off pursuers&#8212;and
those pursuers the representatives of law and order.</p>

<p>However, the prospect of for once being the pursued
rather than the pursuer to some extent tickled
his fancy; he resolved to try his 'prentice hand at
evasion by secretly making his way from Bruton
Street to Walter's Hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter's, he imagined, would be probably safe
from observation for that night at least. Rookley
had practically told Sir Paul that he did not know
where he went when he was not in Bruton Street.</p>

<p>First Westerham called in Blyth and questioned
him pretty closely; he satisfied himself, however,
that whatever the man might think of his master's
methods of life he was at least faithful.</p>

<p>Westerham, indeed, resolved to trust him a great
deal more than he had done up to then, and told
him, without any disguise, that he strongly suspected
that Bruton Street was at that moment being
watched. Casually, and without the slightest
demonstration of surprise, the valet thereupon suggested
that it would be just as well for Westerham
to change his dress before he left the flat.</p>

<p>This he did, and afterwards sent the porter for
a taxicab. Into this he jumped as soon as it arrived,
telling the man to drive to Turnham
Green.</p>

<p>And long before they reached that distant part
of London, Westerham convinced himself that even
had he been pursued at all he had certainly outdistanced
the pursuers.</p>

<p>From Turnham Green he took the District Railway
to Earl's Court. Alighting there, he walked
to South Kensington, where he again took the
train, on this occasion booking straight through to
Whitechapel.</p>

<p>From St. Mary's, Whitechapel, he turned south,
and plunging through a maze of little streets came
on foot to Limehouse at about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>He had little difficulty in finding the &#8220;Cut,&#8221; and
walking briskly down it, came to the little space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
where the tall, four-storeyed building was set back
from the roadway.</p>

<p>Always quick to observe detail, he had not only
noticed but he recollected Melun's peculiar rap. So
three times he knocked slowly, and again three
times slowly, and then three times in quick succession.</p>

<p>As on the former occasion, the door swung open
at once, and the hideous face of the negro he had
treated so cavalierly before peered at him from
the darkness.</p>

<p>The nigger peered eagerly about as though seeking
for Melun, and when he saw that Westerham
stood there alone, made as though to slam the door
on him.</p>

<p>But Westerham was too quick for him, and
thrust his heavy-booted foot into the opening and
laughed in the negro's face.</p>

<p>The negro cursed him roundly and demanded
what he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me in,&#8221; said Westerham, quietly, &#8220;and I
will explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most unwillingly the negro opened the door, and
Westerham, entering the passage, looked the black
squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that it is none of your business to inquire
what I want?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was brought
here by Captain Melun and properly introduced, if
such is the term you use. And my affairs at
the present moment are with the gentlemen of
the club. I will thank you to take me there at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro gave him an ugly look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Captain Melun send you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Mind your own business,&#8221; retorted Westerham,
sharply. &#8220;Lead the way. I shall say what I
have to say to my friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't play the fool,&#8221; he added as the man still
looked doubtful. &#8220;What do you take me for? A
&#8216;tec&#8217;? If I were, do you think I should be ass
enough to come here alone and ask to be shown
into that crowd?&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro grinned as much as to say that he
thought him an ass in any case, but he led the way
down the passage none the less.</p>

<p>They passed through the opium den as before,
and then it seemed that the negro purposely made
no disturbance in order that Westerham's entrance
might have a proper dramatic effect.</p>

<p>He was right in his estimation of the confusion
it would cause.</p>

<p>If one may so term it, the parliament of scoundrels
was in full session. The long trestle table was
in the centre of the room, and at one end of it sat
the bullet-headed man, while at the other was the
young ruffian whom Westerham knew by the name
of Crow.</p>

<p>It was evidently Crow, too, who was in supreme
command.</p>

<p>The bullet-headed man rose up and stared at Westerham
with starting eyes. The other men followed
his gaze and leapt to their feet with cries
and oaths.</p>

<p>Crow, of the vicious eyes and the hawk-like nose
and the large, brutal hands, alone seemed undismayed.</p>

<p>The negro, having waited just sufficiently long
to watch the sensation caused by Westerham's entrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
had slipped out of the club-room on silent
feet.</p>

<p>Crow, in a quick, hard voice, cried, &#8220;The
door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, as though their stations had by previous
arrangements been allotted them&#8212;as was indeed
the case&#8212;two men jumped from their seats
and put their backs against the door. As they
stood there they drew their knives, and on taking
a step forward Westerham found himself cut off
from retreat and facing the angry eyes of quite a
score of men.</p>

<p>Two of them had pulled out revolvers, but Crow
caught their action with quick and angry eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't be fools,&#8221; he said; &#8220;put those barkers
away. We want no noise down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sullenly the men obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the table, Mr. Robinson,&#8221; said Crow,
in a manner which suggested he had no doubt that
his instructions would be followed, &#8220;and explain
what this intrusion means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham laughed and drew away from the
men with the knives. He walked easily down to
the table to the place which had been vacated by
the bullet-headed man, and without so much as a
word of apology took that plump and furious person's
seat.</p>

<p>He looked easily and almost lazily along the lines
of vicious faces until his gaze finally rested on
Crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood,&#8221; he said, in a pleasant voice,
&#8220;that after my introduction the other night I was
at liberty to come here when I pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,&#8221; said Crow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> &#8220;you have made
a mistake. We had no desire to see you then, much
less had we any wish to set eyes on you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not!&#8221; blared the bullet-headed
man.</p>

<p>From the rest of the men came murmurs and
angry words.</p>

<p>&#8220;My visit,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;should be of considerable
interest to you all. It is also of considerable
interest to myself, as it proves that you act
independently of Melun. I understood from him
that you held no council unless he was with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you his cursed spy?&#8221; cried the man on
his right, rising from his seat and bringing his fist
down with a bang on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Westerham, looking the man straight
in the face, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Smith!&#8221; shouted Crow.</p>

<p>The man sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my pretty gentleman,&#8221; Crow went on,
&#8220;we have had enough of you, just as we have had
enough of Melun, who has brought you into this
business for no good so far as we are concerned,
and we do not propose that matters should go any
further; in fact, it is rather handy that you thought
of coming down East to us, as otherwise we should
have come up West to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Westerham, who was still smiling
at Crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Crow went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> &#8220;you have saved us a
great deal of trouble. You are a cool hand, Mr.
Robinson, but we are just as cool. This spot was
not chosen for its beauty; it was chosen for its advantages.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this some of the men laughed coarsely, while
several of them swore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melun's kid-glove business is all very well in
its way. It has made a bit of money in its time,
but it seems to us&#8212;we were just discussing the
matter to-night&#8212;that we can do pretty well without
the captain and his swells up West.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a long time since his nice West End pals
brought any grist to our mill, and we don't propose
to go on like this for ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brought matters to a head was your
arrival. We can stand a good deal, and we can
wait a good deal. We are financed now and again
by men whom we never set eyes on, and, according
to Melun, we pay them a pretty rate of interest for
our share of the work, but that is neither here nor
there. What we do object to&#8212;and what you will
find we object to to the extent of putting an end to
it&#8212;is the importation of Yankee swankers from
the States.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham raised a protesting hand, but Crow
did not heed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is no use your objecting,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we
can read you like a book. Things have been worse
ever since your arrival. Melun has practically
never been near us so that we have been left to our
own resources. Well, we don't mind that; but we
will see that the resources are such as we like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed a jarring laugh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now you may be as bad as the worst of us,
and it may be you won't stick at much; and it may
be that you have in that clever head a thousand
ways of keeping us in funds. I should say by the
look of you, you had.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should say, too, that you were one of
the mean breed, who keeps things to himself. You
are too much class for us. We don't suit your
book, and so we can rot while you and Melun
spend the dibs up West. Now, that's not good
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crow looked round the table, the men nodded,
and he continued:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to end it here and now. Mark
you, Mr. High-and-Mighty, we owe you one grudge
already. We did not go looking after you to interfere
with your pleasures, which probably are a
deal worse than ours. In the same way, we do not
allow any interference with what we do down
here.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a thing which Melun himself never dares
to do, and why should you? It's more than we can
stand. I am talking about those girls the other
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham was still smiling with his eyes hard
and bright. &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you had better
let me inform you that if I found the same state
of things going on to-night I should interfere
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the men stared in astonishment at his
audacity. Crow's face went white with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you, my beauty? I don't think you
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in a flash he had drawn a six-shooter from
his pocket and yelled &#8220;Hands up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham laughed outright. Unless he should
so lose control over himself as to act foolishly he
knew that Crow would not fire. He had already
told two men that they wanted no firing that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>So, instead of putting his hands up, he folded
them placidly on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that thing away,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;until
you explain precisely what you intend to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crow lowered his weapon but kept it on the
table. He even laughed a hard, short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are a good plucked 'un at any rate,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and as your number's up, and dead men
tell no tales, I don't see why I shouldn't oblige you.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think,&#8221; he continued, making an attempt
to imitate Westerham's cool, off-hand way of
speech, &#8220;that this is a working-man's club.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is not exactly that. It is a club, sure
enough, with pretty fixed rules&#8212;rules which, if
broken, may result in a man's light being put out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same may be said of anyone who offends
us. You have offended us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, though Melun comes in through &#8216;The
Cut,&#8217; we come in the other way. No one in London
except the members of this club know that
there are two entrances. We come in by the main
door, and that gives on to a path which runs by a
handy canal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shooting is noisy, and knives mean messy
work. Strangling is just as simple and just as
easy, and, with the clothes off you, and with a good
lead weight on your feet, there'd not be much
chance of your disappearance ever being traced to
this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at Westerham with a fixed beast-like
glare.</p>

<p>Westerham, however, with his hands still folded
placidly on the table, was smiling blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me,&#8221; he said, seeing that Crow had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
an end of speaking, &#8220;to congratulate you on a very
pretty little programme&#8212;but a programme which,
I fear, is hardly likely to be carried out to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Str'wth,&#8221; cried a man, craning across the
table towards Westerham, &#8220;are you a copper's
nark? Have you put the police on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Half a dozen men rose from their seats and
looked with scared faces at Crow.</p>

<p>Crow, somewhat to Westerham's admiration,
kept his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;See to the door,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Two other men rose, and going to Westerham's
side of the long room, opened the door leading into
a little porch; through this they went out on to
the footpath by the canal and peered cautiously up
and down.</p>

<p>Presently they came back shaking their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have another look,&#8221; said Crow. &#8220;Search a
little further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men went out again, and in the complete
silence which now prevailed their footsteps could
be heard through the open door pacing up and
down the path.</p>

<p>Returning, they reported that everything was
quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Crow, &#8220;but, all the same, you
had better get to your posts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men went out once more and closed the
door after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bluff!&#8221; said Crow, insolently, to Westerham,
&#8220;just bluff. But you cannot come bluff on us, for
all your Yankee smartness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Westerham; and his face was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the face of a man who is immensely amused and interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you grinning at?&#8221; snarled Crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was grinning because, whatever you may contrive
to do to me, it struck me as being rather
funny that one man in a place like this should
manage to scare so many.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crow's hand gripped the handle of his revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said Westerham, growing suddenly
serious, for he realised that while the men
were posted at either end of the canal-path there
was just a chance that Crow might risk the noise
of firearms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Crow,&#8221; Westerham continued, &#8220;I
have allowed you to say a good deal and insult me
very considerably. As a matter of fact, I do not
happen to be an American&#8212;not that that makes
very much difference. Who I am and where I
come from is no concern of yours. And I don't
propose to tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I propose to tell you something else, though,
and I regret to say that it is a tale of breach of
faith&#8212;of a breach of faith committed by a member
of what you are pleased to call &#8216;the club.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;The name of the offending member,&#8221; said Westerham,
slowly and deliberately, &#8220;is Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of this name most of the men
broke out into volleys of cursing; but Westerham
held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I entered into a certain agreement with Melun
on certain terms,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> &#8220;Is it news to you that
the price I offered for his services and for the services
of yourselves was a hundred thousand
pounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; Crow exclaimed, and then sat
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>The rest of the men were too astonished to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a liar!&#8221; shouted Crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I am no liar,
as I am quite prepared to prove to you. Now I
have every intention, provided that Melun holds
good to his promise, of handing him over that
sum. I simply tell you this in order that you may
see to it that you get your proper shares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You liar!&#8221; exclaimed Crow again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;but you really
are mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand into his breast and pulled out a
pocket-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have the sum of ten thousand
pounds in notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing them out, he flung them carelessly on
the table.</p>

<p>So utterly were the men lost in amazement that
they could do nothing but stare in silence at the
notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I may as well be quite frank,&#8221; Westerham
went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> &#8220;and tell you that I have not the
slightest intention of handing those notes over to
you. Nor, for that matter, do I intend having
them stolen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might take them from me, but you would
merely have to destroy them, for I have taken the
precaution of informing the bank that all these
notes have been lost. I can well afford to let such
a sum as this lie idle for a time, and the numbers
were posted this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; said Crow once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Westerham continued as evenly as ever,
&#8220;I hope that this, to some extent, proves that what
I say is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the men nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Westerham, looking about him, &#8220;I
will take it for granted that you are prepared to
believe me. So far so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have now to tell you that Captain Melun is
at the present moment engaged in a deal of the
most stupendous proportions. He has mentioned
to me that the sum he hopes to net is over a quarter
of a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked round at the men again.
They continued to stare at him open-mouthed, remaining
entirely silent. They were beyond all
speech.</p>

<p>Glancing at Crow, Westerham saw with satisfaction
that he was evidently much amazed and beginning
to look uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen,&#8221; Westerham continued, &#8220;it is
unnecessary for me to mention the names of the
people who are assisting Captain Melun in this enterprise.
I really believe that they don't even know
what the enterprise is. But there is an exception.
One of them does know, because the business may
involve dirtier work than Melun may care to do
with his own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham paused, and saw that Crow's face
was as pale as ashes.</p>

<p>Again his intuition proved to be correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he cried, rising, and pointing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
accusing finger at Crow, &#8220;that is the man who
knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a lie!&#8221; shrieked Crow; &#8220;it's a lie! It is
only a matter of ten thousand pounds. Melun
swore it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the silence that followed Westerham laughed
loud and long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I ask you if ever
a man more completely condemned himself out of
his own mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the tide of anger turned and swept towards
Crow.</p>

<p>There was a great clamour, while the men, with
curses, shouted at him for an explanation.</p>

<p>Then above the hubbub there came a loud knocking,
and turning in the direction of the sound they
saw Melun, smiling and pleasant-looking as ever,
pounding on the floor with his stick, while the
negro stood behind him, grinning over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Instantly silence fell again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; called Melun, coolly, &#8220;be quiet,
all of you. Be quiet at once. We have been betrayed,
and the man who has betrayed us is there!&#8221;</p>

<p>For some seconds the men looked from Westerham
to Melun, and then from Melun to Westerham.
But the power of their old allegiance held
good, and before he could utter a sound Westerham
was seized and borne savagely to the floor.</p>

<p>When he found himself pinned to the ground
Westerham made not the slightest attempt to struggle.
He had been in similar predicaments before,
and knew that a policy of passive resistance was
best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>And, just as he had expected, when he made no
effort to release himself the men partially relaxed
their hold of him. Two of them, indeed, dragged
him into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>By this time Melun had taken his place at the
head of the long table, and was rapping on the
bare boards for order and for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two of you are enough there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
rest of you get back to your seats.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men followed his instructions hastily and
almost sheepishly.</p>

<p>When they were all seated again, Melun looked
down their ranks sharply and a little furtively.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br /><span class="smaller">MURDER MYSTERIOUS</span></h2>


<p>Melun's glance down the ranks of the men satisfied
him that he had things well in hand.</p>

<p>The bullet-headed man was shifting about on
his seat, and Crow sat with a pasty face, twisting
and bending his great, brutal fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Melun, almost politely, &#8220;I
expect you feel that some explanation is due from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The majority of the men nodded in a surly way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Melun continued, &#8220;the explanation is
simplicity itself. I have been duped by that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he pointed to Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;He introduced himself to me,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;as
a colleague in our own particular line of business,
and suggested certain schemes to me. Some of
them appeared to me to be good, but I may as well
tell you that they were at the moment of no use to
me, as I had on hand a piece of business which, if I
had pulled it off, would have enabled us to rest on
our laurels for a considerable period.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Melun laughed to himself. Westerham
was sitting bolt upright on the floor, with
every evidence of the closest attention. He was
of half a mind to call Melun a liar there and then,
but he knew that the greater the lies, and the more
the lies, the easier he could refute them. So he
let Melun run on without protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> &#8220;it was a very
great piece of business indeed, so important a
piece of business that it was necessary to keep it
from even my most intimate friends and helpers.
There was nothing unusual in this, for, as you
know, I have often conducted campaigns without
letting you into my secrets until success had been
assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this occasion, considering the position of
the person I was assailing, the strictest secrecy was
necessary. I didn't even inform the kind friend
who finances us what I was about. I didn't even
tell Crow of my movements, though I had informed
him that something out of the common was
in view.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, with the appearance of that man
whom you now see convicted as a traitor, there
was introduced into our affairs a certain element&#8212;treachery
and suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;One never knows,&#8221; Melun went on with calm
mendacity, &#8220;of what one may be accused; and I
therefore took the precaution to inform at least one
of you of what I was about, lest it should be
charged against me that I was playing the rest of
you false.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man to whom I spoke of this matter was
Patmore. Patmore, be good enough to stand up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore rose and glanced uneasily at his chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be so kind as to repeat, as accurately as you
can, what I told you,&#8221; Melun ordered him.</p>

<p>Patmore began to speak rapidly, and with what,
to a keen observer, might have seemed a somewhat
parrot-like air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me,&#8221; he said, looking at Melun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> &#8220;that
this was a matter of blackmail.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke quite unblushingly, as though such a
business was an every-day affair, which, as a matter
of fact, it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that the person
to be blackmailed occupied a high position in the
State, and that it was so necessary for him to purchase
our silence that he would pay practically any
price.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mentioned a quarter of a million, of
which you yourself proposed to take fifty thousand
pounds, dividing the rest of the money
among us. You also took the oath of the club
before me and declared that whatever might be
said to the contrary you were determined to play
fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You further said that it was absolutely impossible
to reveal any details of the scheme to me, as,
should anyone know of the matter besides yourself,
discovery would be inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, you declared that it was the most difficult,
and at the same time the boldest, piece of
work that you had ever attempted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore stopped abruptly in his recitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that, gentlemen,&#8221; said Melun, nodding towards
the men, &#8220;is absolutely true.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is also true,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that to win
this vast amount of money it was necessary to lay
out a certain amount of capital. I hadn't the
money on hand, and it was inadvisable to approach
the usual sources.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trusted&#8221;&#8212;and there was an increased bitterness
in his voice&#8212;&#8220;I trusted this man Robinson.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, would you believe me, gentlemen, I have
just discovered that he is not Robinson at all, nor
Smith, nor Jones&#8212;nor anyone, indeed, of small importance
in this world?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen, it would be inadvisable at
this moment to tell you precisely who he is, but one
thing I may tell you, and that is that he is a gentleman
of title, and a man of wealth and position.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men turned their wondering gaze on Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, for what purpose do you suppose that a
man of title, of wealth and position is mixing himself
up with our affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun paused for a few minutes, and watched
with satisfaction intelligence dawn on the stupid,
brutal faces before him, which stared first at himself
in amazement, and then gloomily and savagely
at Westerham.</p>

<p>Westerham, however, to their further astonishment,
was laughing quietly, his teeth bared in quite
an amused and pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; Melun continued, &#8220;it is one
of our unbreakable rules that all traitors must die.
Therefore, anyone who is likely to betray us must
die also.</p>

<p>&#8220;From what I know of this man,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;he will be too proud to purchase his freedom. In
short, not to put too fine a point on it, we cannot
bleed him, though his wealth is enormous. I fancy
it runs into millions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little cries of wonderment and anger broke from
the glowering men round the table.</p>

<p>Westerham laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; cried Melun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> &#8220;though I much regret
the necessity of having to take such a step, I am
afraid this gentleman's last hour has arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;His death,&#8221; he added quietly, &#8220;will be carried
out by the usual means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crow started eagerly from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it to be done at once?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; said Melun.</p>

<p>All this time, though he had laughed now and
again and never ceased to smile a bold, amused
smile, Westerham's quick brain was taking in every
word and watching for some means of deliverance.
He saw that he was in an extremely tight corner,
but he did not doubt his ability to find a way out.</p>

<p>The two men who were acting as his warders
suddenly seized his hands, and before he quite
realised his position Westerham found himself
handcuffed.</p>

<p>Still, however, he made no resistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he cried, raising his voice so that
it rang through the room and dominated all who
were gathered there, &#8220;gentlemen, a man is usually
permitted to say something when he has been condemned
to death. I make no quarrel with your
decision. If I were in your place I should probably
do the same myself by another man as you
are doing by me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't wish to dispute your decision, much less
do I wish to plead for mercy. Melun has denounced
me for the simple reason that I have the
misfortune to be a gentleman. Well, gentlemen
have a habit of dying as such.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust I shall be no exception to the rule, but
still, before you carry out your kind intentions, I
should like to say something to Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him to the table,&#8221; said Melun. He
looked uneasily at Westerham and avoided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
steadiness of his glance. He felt that the moment
was an awkward one. It was unwise to allow
Westerham to speak; on the other hand, it would
have been folly to deny him the privilege.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; he demanded sharply as
Westerham stepped up to the table and leant his
manacled hands on it.</p>

<p>Westerham bent forward over the table as far
as he could and looked Melun straight in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not strangle me,&#8221; he said in a very
quiet voice, &#8220;because <span class="smcap">THEY ARE NOT WHERE THEY
WERE</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun turned pale as ashes, and seemed to shrink
in his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, man, what do you mean?&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>Once again the men were glancing stupidly from
Westerham to Melun, and back from Melun to
Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said Westerham, more pointedly
than before, &#8220;that <span class="smcap">THEY ARE NOT WHERE THEY
WERE</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long and uncomfortable pause while
Melun sat rigid in his chair biting his nails.</p>

<p>Westerham had made a long shot, and had found
the mark.</p>

<p>He had argued that Melun's control over the
Premier was due to the illegal possession of some
of Lord Penshurst's papers, though he did not
know whom these papers might concern nor where
Melun had placed them.</p>

<p>Certainly the captain had not hidden them in his
own rooms, nor in the rooms of any of his confederates;
for without a doubt if Lord Penshurst had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
not scrupled to burgle Westerham's flat, he would
not scruple to ransack the houses of Melun or his
friends.</p>

<p>Indeed, Westerham guessed that the hiding-place
must be a very strange and secret one&#8212;so
strange and so secret that probably only the subtle
mind of Melun could have conceived it.</p>

<p>Thus he had come to the conclusion that it would
cause Melun most terrible alarm if that individual
even suspected he had an inkling of the
whereabouts of the papers. Nor was he mistaken.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully Melun pulled himself together.
The easy confidence which had marked his
manner and his talk a few moments before was
now utterly gone. He was a broken, almost a
cringing, man; and Westerham realised that Lord
Penshurst could not be setting any fictitious value
on the stolen papers.</p>

<p>These papers could involve no mere matter of
sentiment or personal honour or pride. Some
colossal undertaking must be at stake.</p>

<p>It was also obvious to Westerham that if the
papers fell into strange hands the consequences
must be terrible for all concerned. For the anxiety
and fear on Melun's face were greater than the
anxiety and fear of a man who hazards all in a
great stake and thinks he has lost.</p>

<p>Presently Melun got unsteadily out of his chair
and came round the table to Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand away there!&#8221; he said to the two men
who were guarding the baronet. &#8220;Stand away
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men fell back, and Melun, coming close up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to Westerham, whispered in his ear: &#8220;What do
you mean that &#8216;they are not where they were&#8217;?
Do you mean the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; Melun whispered again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to say,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>He might well decline, for he had not the least
idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make you tell me, you dog!&#8221; cried
Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won't,&#8221; answered Westerham, suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven!&#8221; shouted Melun, &#8220;but I will.
There are more unpleasant things done in this place
than you ever dreamt of in your philosophy. The
times of the Inquisition are not past for some people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take a little more than you to frighten
me, you cur,&#8221; said Westerham, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Melun's face blazed with passion. He drew
back a pace, and then struck Westerham heavily
across the mouth.</p>

<p>On his part Westerham did not hesitate for a
moment. He lifted both his fettered hands and
brought his steel-bound wrists down with a crash
on Melun's head; and the captain went sprawling
to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look you here,&#8221; cried Westerham to the dumbfounded
ruffians who stood watching the scene as
though they were chained to their chairs. &#8220;Look
you here; I will deal with men, but not with curs
such as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched Melun with his boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot deny,&#8221; he continued, purposely
dropping to a certain extent into their own jargon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
&#8220;that I was game. I was prepared to die, but I am
not prepared to be struck by swine like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he went on, turning Melun's prostrate
body over with his foot, &#8220;he is a liar through and
through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I speak the truth just now when I convicted
Crow out of his own mouth? I did. I
proved it. And surely Melun has now condemned
himself in his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that there would be all this fuss
over a bundle of papers if there weren't more in
the matter than he ever intended to tell you? Not
a bit of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men murmured angry assent, and Westerham
felt that he was at last winning through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he went on boldly, &#8220;that I
am the kind of man who deserves to be tortured
to reveal the truth? I say no; and so will
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the men nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fellow Melun says that I have betrayed
him and you. Let him prove it. I tell him that
&#8216;the papers are not where they were.&#8217; He knows
where he placed them; let him go and see. I am
content to abide here until he returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the bullet-headed man to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get him to his feet,&#8221; he said, pointing to
Melun.</p>

<p>Melun was dragged up, dazed and bleeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do nothing to this gentleman,&#8221; said
the bullet-headed man, waving his hand with some
deference towards Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> &#8220;until you have
cleared yourself. You will have to see if the
papers are gone. But you don't go alone&#8212;not
much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Crow spoke up: &#8220;Let me go with him,&#8221;
he pleaded.</p>

<p>The bullet-headed man shook his head. &#8220;You
have almost as much to answer for as Melun,&#8221; he
objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Ross is the man. We
can trust Ross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross came forward as though the task of watching
Melun was not an unwelcome one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can trust me. I will
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then pull him together a bit,&#8221; ordered the
bullet-headed man.</p>

<p>Thereupon they roughly plucked Melun's clothes
into shape, sponged his face clear of blood, set his
hat on his head, and put his stick into his hand.</p>

<p>By this time he had practically recovered himself.
He gave one quick look of intense hatred
towards Westerham and one quick, vindictive
glance in the direction of the man with the bullet
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, in a rather shaky voice.
&#8220;If it must be, it must be. You are fools to believe
your enemy, but I cannot prevent you. If
you must know all, you will probably lose all; well&#8212;so
much the worse for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He jerked his waistcoat down and assumed a certain
air of bravado. In spite of himself, Westerham
could not but admire the man. At this point
Crow urged again that he should be allowed to accompany
Melun. Ross made no objection, and he
was given leave to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The scoundrels round the table then watched
Melun take his departure with Ross and Crow.
The room was very quiet, and Westerham could
hear the men's retreating footsteps along the path
of the canal.</p>

<p>When they had quite ceased to be audible Westerham
turned again to the bullet-headed man.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you suppose,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;we
shall have to wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows,&#8221; answered the fat man, with a
shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if you will permit me,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;I will sit down. And,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I should be
obliged to you if you will remove these.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stretched out his handcuffed wrists.</p>

<p>One of the men laughed and knocked them off.
Westerham thanked him and sat down.</p>

<p>Without more ado he took out his cigarette-case
and lit a cigarette. As he smoked he turned things
rapidly over in his mind. He was perfectly certain
that Melun, in spite of his protestations, would
not reveal the whereabouts of the papers. Westerham
even doubted whether Melun would take the
trouble to lead the man on a bogus chase.</p>

<p>For some reason which he was unable to account
for he had a foreboding of coming evil. He tried
to shake it off, but in vain.</p>

<p>Time and time again he tried to think matters
out and decide what Melun's probable course of action
would be. But time and time again he failed
to work out any theory which satisfied him.</p>

<p>At last, when half an hour had gone by and the
delay was becoming irksome, Westerham spoke up
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;If you will call for silence,&#8221; he said to the bullet-headed
man, &#8220;there is something else I would
like to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bullet-headed man called at once for order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Westerham, addressing the
men for the third and last time that night, &#8220;will
you allow me to range myself on your side? I
really think I have proved myself sufficiently a man
to warrant my asking this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not take your oath, but if you will take
the word of a gentleman, I will pledge it that,
come what may, I will never reveal to anyone what
has taken place to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was considerable grumbling at this, but
the bullet-headed man forcibly expressed his favourable
opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, mates,&#8221; he cried, turning to the
others, &#8220;I know a gentleman when I see one, and
I know that this gentleman is to be trusted. If
Melun wants to do his own dirty work, let him do
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of all his boasting our hands have been
pretty clean up to the present. It is quite true that
we have always been prepared to put a man out of
the way if it had to be done, but we have never
done it yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there is no reason, so far as I can see, that
we should begin now. So long as we know where
to find this gentleman, that should be good enough
for us. I am not much of a hand at an argument,
but one thing seems to me pretty plain. If this
gent&#8221;&#8212;he indicated Westerham&#8212;&#8220;had wanted to
give us away he would have given us away long
since. No, you may depend upon it that whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
his reasons may be he's got as good cause to keep
silence as we have. Don't you think that's right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a good deal of grumbling, but
on the other hand there was general assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I will tell you what we will do,&#8221; continued
the bullet-headed man, now certain of his ground.
&#8220;We will let him go on one condition&#8212;that he allows
me and another man to accompany him home.
That seems to be fair. It may be taking a bit of a
risk, but it is the only thing to be done unless we
want to do murder, and that is not our game. I
am not taking any chances of hanging while there's
money to be got, and no doubt but that this gentleman
will use us fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham caught his meaning, and for the second
time took out his pocket-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that you would not steal these notes, and
I also said that I would not give them away. But
I have changed my mind. There they are&#8212;and I
give you my word that to-morrow I will take the
embargo off. It will be easy enough for you to
find out whether they are posted as lost or not. I
can scarcely do more.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this there was greedy assent, and Westerham
realised that he was free. He did not even wait
for the bullet-headed man's full approval, but
reached out for his hat.</p>

<p>There was some dispute as to whom the notes
should be given, and finally it was decided that
Mackintosh&#8212;such was the name of the bullet-headed
man&#8212;should keep them in his own charge.
And then he and a second man by the name of
Hicks accompanied Westerham out.</p>

<p>In the main road they took a tram and travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
westward. At Aldgate Westerham hailed a cab,
and the three men drove through the half-empty
city streets, past St. Paul's, and up Fleet Street,
into the Strand.</p>

<p>As they drew near to Walter's, Westerham's
quick eye detected a crowd round the hotel. He
thrust his hand through the trap-door in the roof
and brought the cab to a standstill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said quickly to the other men,
&#8220;that crowd is outside Walter's&#8212;and that is where
I live.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can accompany me to the door if you like
and see me go in; but I should not drive up if I
were you, as you will only arouse interest, and possibly
someone may see and recognise you. That
would be awkward both for you and for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mackintosh gave a grin of agreement, and alighting,
the three men walked towards the hotel.</p>

<p>As they approached the crowd, Mackintosh and
his companion drew away from Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do if we see you go in,&#8221; said the bullet-headed
man, &#8220;we will wait here.&#8221; And he moved
into a little opening on the side of the street opposite
the hotel.</p>

<p>Westerham struck across the Strand and pushed
his way through the press. The hotel door was
closed and guarded on either side by a constable.
Through the glass doorway Westerham could see
the face of the hall porter peering out, pale and
anxious and questioning.</p>

<p>He rapped on the door, and the porter opened it,
the policemen making no demur, seeing that the
porter obviously recognised the new arrival.</p>

<p>At the further end of the hall were gathered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
number of the visitors, talking excitedly, but in low
voices.</p>

<p>Two immensely large and solid men were seated
on a bench. They rose up as Westerham entered,
and he immediately recognised one of them as the
inquisitive Mr. Rookley from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Rookley, with a stern, set face, walked forward
to meet Westerham, and touched him with a forefinger
on his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been waiting for you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The sense of coming evil against which Westerham
had struggled earlier in the evening swept over
him again with redoubled force. He made an effort
to shake it off, but again failed to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, and his voice sounded
strange and harsh even to himself.</p>

<p>Without a word, Rookley grasped his arm and
led him up the stairs, nor did he stop till he reached
the second floor, on which were situated Westerham's
sitting-room and modest bedroom.</p>

<p>Opening the door of the sitting-room, Rookley
drew Westerham in and closed the door again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Robinson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you gave
us the slip last time, I admit; and I admit also that
it was only by a very dreadful miracle that I discovered
your whereabouts to-night. For I was summoned
here on an awful piece of business. But
we've got you now, and I want an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham stared at him with a set face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, one thing is certain&#8212;I will give you that
much credit&#8221;&#8212;the detective continued&#8212;&#8220;that you
are not the actual perpetrator of what has happened.
Perhaps, too, it would be better to prepare
you for a shock, though you look a pretty strong-nerved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
man. You'd better brace yourself, Mr. Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Westerham, quietly.</p>

<p>Without more ado the detective pushed open the
door communicating with Westerham's bedroom
and led the way in.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness, but Rookley, putting
his thumb on the electric button, suddenly switched
on the light. And with a cry Westerham stepped
back and blundered against the detective.</p>

<p>For on the bed was stretched Ross, the man who
had left him in the company of Crow and Melun;
and driven hard up to the hilt, straight through the
man's heart, was a knife which Westerham instantly
recognised as one of his own.</p>

<p>The detective seized him almost roughly and
hurried him mercilessly up to the bedside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read that!&#8221; he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>Westerham stooped and saw attached to the
handle of the knife a luggage label which bore the
name of Walter's hotel.</p>

<p>And on the luggage label was printed in hand-writing
the following inscription:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;So perish all traitors. Be warned in time. The
girl may be the next.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br /><span class="smaller">THE PRIME MINISTER IS COMPROMISED</span></a></h2>


<p>Horrified though he was, Westerham made no
sign. He had stood in the presence of death before,
and he had faced it in more dreadful forms,
though it is true he had never known it so intimately
and so poignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl may be the next,&#8221; the words seemed
ominous&#8212;like a doom. Troubles encompassed him
on every side. An hour or so previously he had
faced the greatest odds he had ever known till then.
The odds were greater now.</p>

<p>Conscious that the keen eyes of Rookley were
upon him, he saw that instant action was necessary,
and turning on his heel he walked deliberately into
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>The detective followed him, and then seating
himself at the table, Westerham bade the man take
a chair.</p>

<p>For a moment the detective's face lighted up with
anticipation. It seemed to him that at last the
mysterious Mr. Robinson was about to make some
statement. His anticipations were, however, to be
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Westerham, in a pleasant, even
voice, &#8220;I am waiting for you to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hoping,&#8221; said Mr. Rookley, &#8220;that you
were about to make some statement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never make statements,&#8221; said Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
&#8220;any more than I answer questions which are inconvenient.
What have you to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the detective leant forward and spoke
so quickly that Westerham was almost thrown off
his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, Mr. Robinson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only give you the same answer,&#8221; said
Westerham, &#8220;which I gave you before&#8212;that my
name is my own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are aware, of course,&#8221; pursued Rookley,
&#8220;that the present occasion is more serious than the
last. You seem to have an unfortunate habit of
coming in on the heels of awkward occurrences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem like it just now,&#8221; agreed Westerham.</p>

<p>There was a pause and Westerham was the first
to speak again. &#8220;As you yourself know full well
that I was not here when this business happened, I
think that you had better clear the ground by telling
me all you know if you wish me to assist you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rookley looked at him sharply, but decided that
Westerham was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;At about ten o'clock two men called and asked
for you. Both of them were dressed rather like
sailors, one man being short, the other tall. They
were told that you were out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tall man, however, said that he had come
to see you in response to a letter, and that, as he
knew you had a sitting-room, he would be obliged
if they would allow him to wait with his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the men were both quiet and respectable in
dress and in manner, they were allowed to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a little while the taller of the two men
went down to the hall and told the porter that he
had left his friend upstairs, and that he himself was
going out to buy some cigarettes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The porter was a little surprised, but said nothing,
but when half an hour had gone by he grew
uneasy and going upstairs to the sitting-room discovered
what you have just seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;The body was not touched, and we were immediately
summoned by the police at Bow Street.
The police-surgeon happened to be absent, and has
not yet called. That accounts for the body being
still undisturbed. We had, as a matter of fact,
only been here a few minutes when you yourself
arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's all that I can tell you up to the present,&#8221;
said the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were the men like?&#8221; asked Westerham,
though he had by this time little doubt as to the
identity of the murderer, just as he knew well
enough the identity of the victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;The murdered man,&#8221; said the detective, &#8220;you
have seen yourself. The murderer&#8212;for there is
not the slightest doubt that the taller of the two
men stabbed the other&#8212;is described as being spare
in build and black-bearded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black-bearded?&#8221; said Westerham, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Rookley looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have suspicions?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a man without them?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, sir,&#8221; urged the detective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> &#8220;this is
not a time for jesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not jesting,&#8221; said Westerham, and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think,&#8221; asked the detective after a
little while, &#8220;it would be better if you were to
make a clean breast of everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you frankly, Mr. Robinson,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;that I have changed my opinion about yourself.
At first I thought you were a dupe of Melun's, but
I was soon convinced that a man so astute as yourself
could not possibly have been misled even by
that clever scoundrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, it seemed to me improbable that a gentleman
of such ingenuity as yourself should have
become a victim of any conspiracy. No, sir, it appears
to me&#8212;mind, I am giving you every credit&#8212;that
you are in some way bound up with a very
extraordinary network of crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;What it is, of course, I cannot tell, unless you
trust me. I wish you would see the wisdom of
giving me your confidence. In the meantime I can
only theorise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley paused and looked infinitely wise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all probability,&#8221; Mr. Rookley proceeded,
&#8220;you have become involved in some peculiar kind
of vendetta. I assure you, sir, that when you are
as versed in the machinations of mankind as I am
you will not find such a supposition as mine at all
romantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, however, such is the case, then Melun plays
a part in it. And if Melun plays a part in it,&#8221; concluded
the detective, with a fine show of pitiless
logic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> &#8220;then he had a hand in this. Now tell me,
sir, do you suspect him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must once again,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;be allowed
to point out that what I suspect is no affair
of yours at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't mind telling you, however, that I am
involved in a very remarkable conspiracy. The
part which I play is entirely innocent; on the other
hand, it is impossible for me to make the faintest
revelation concerning it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is not the end of it,&#8221; cried Rookley.
&#8220;By no means the end of it. Look at the threat on
the luggage label. &#8216;The girl may be the next.&#8217;
Now, what does that mean? Who is the girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's ruddy face grew a little pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the lady it is my business
to shelter and protect. By holding silent I can
at least secure her life; if I breathe one word I
can well believe that her fate may be the same as
that of the man within.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, sir,&#8221; said the detective, banging his fist
on the table, &#8220;it is your duty to tell us everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police can give protection to all who need
it,&#8221; he added after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police did not save the dead,&#8221; answered
Westerham. &#8220;And they cannot save the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson,&#8221; said the detective, darkly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> &#8220;if
you persist in silence I must resort to extreme
measures. There was no justification in my detaining
you yesterday over the gagging of your
valet. But this is an entirely different piece of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is murder, and I should not be doing my
duty if I did not turn every stone to bring the murderer
to justice, I warn you solemnly that there
is such a thing as being charged with complicity,
and, if you continue to defy me as you do, then I
shall have no other course but to take you in
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear man,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;don't be a
fool. Let me implore you not to be led by a little
exercise of your authority into taking a step which
you would for ever regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been extremely clever in your
theories, but you have not been quite clever enough.
I don't wish to be unkind, but you have lacked imagination.
This is not some comparatively small
affair; it is by no means a vendetta; it is by no
means a quarrel over a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an affair in which half the participators
act in blind ignorance. There are possibly only
three people in existence who can throw any light
on the matter. And they occupy such a position
in this world that it would be extremely unwise
for you to take any steps without their
sanction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know who are concerned in the matter,&#8221;
said the detective. &#8220;It is that of which I complain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; answered Westerham, &#8220;am not in a
position to enlighten you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing, however, I can tell you,&#8221; said the
detective, &#8220;and that is that however he may be indirectly
concerned in this murder, Melun himself
did not actually commit it. I have already ascertained
that he was in his club at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he expected Westerham to betray the slightest
surprise, Rookley was disappointed. For although,
as a matter of fact, he was astounded at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
this information, Sir Paul continued to stare at his
interrogator in stony and unemotional silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; was the only remark he made.</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley rose and rang the bell, and when
the servant appeared, asked him to request Mr.
Moore to step upstairs.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Moore, the young detective
whose acquaintance Westerham had made
at his rooms in Bruton Street the day before, came
briskly into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Moore,&#8221; said the detective, solemnly, &#8220;we
must do our duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our task to charge this gentleman with being
concerned in this business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham turned his hard, stern eyes on Moore,
and the man felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; he said, looking at his chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Westerham, &#8220;before you do so, I
want to ask you one or two questions. You, of
course, are responsible to the Commissioner?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rookley nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Commissioner is responsible to the
Home Secretary?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rookley nodded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Home Secretary is, to a certain extent,
responsible to the Prime Minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Rookley nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That being so,&#8221; Westerham continued, &#8220;will
you allow me to ask you if you have ever known
even as bad a business as this hushed up for high
political motives?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rookley started and stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see you have,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not Russia, sir,&#8221; remarked Mr. Rookley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;but, on the other hand,
Russian methods are not wholly unknown in this
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mr. Rookley's turn to look uncomfortable
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Westerham, &#8220;you have
warned me. I want to warn you. In dealing with
me you are dealing with no ordinary person. I assure
you that by my silence I am doing my duty by
the State, although I practically know no more
what this means than you do. I give you my word
on that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, however, sufficient to appreciate that
my arrest must result in a great many inquiries,
the effect of which will be disastrous, not only to
individuals, but to the State. I repeat again that
I cannot see plainly in what way, but I have sufficient
knowledge to justify my assuming this conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I ask you therefore is this: Will you
allow me to write a note to the Prime Minister in
person? I will abide by the answer, which you can
easily get from Downing Street within the space
of half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley's face suddenly brightened, and
there was a certain triumphant air in his manner,
as much as to say that he had convicted Westerham
of having blundered badly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister is away,&#8221; he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> &#8220;but his private
secretary, the Hon. Claude Hilden, is at No.
10. There is, moreover, a private telephone wire
to Trant Hall. I know that because I was at the
Hall yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rookley opened his eyes wide. His astonishment
was intense and undisguised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write that note,&#8221; said Westerham&#8212;&#8220;and
believe me that the writing of it will save a vast
deal of trouble&#8212;on one condition. Will you pledge
me your word that it shall not be tampered with
and shall not be read by anyone until it is placed
in the hands of Mr. Hilden himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments the detective looked worried
and doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said finally; &#8220;but, of course,
you must realise that if you are simply putting up
a game on us the consequences will be all the worse
for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly aware,&#8221; said Westerham, coldly,
&#8220;of precisely what I am doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon he rose, and, going over to the writing-table,
hastily wrote the following letter:&#8212;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="outdent">&#8220;To the Honourable Claude Hilden, Private Secretary
to the Right Honourable the Earl of
Penshurst.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">&#8220;<i>Personal and private.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&#8212;Kindly inform Lord Penshurst at
once by telephone that the writer of this note&#8212;Mr.
James Robinson, of Bruton Street&#8212;whose
rooms were burglariously entered by yourself yesterday
afternoon&#8212;is in an awkward predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your own convenience I occupied, besides
the flat in Bruton Street, rooms in Walter's Hotel.
During my absence to-night an atrocious murder
was committed in those rooms. The detectives
called in to take charge of the case are convinced
that, while I am not the murderer, I am involved
in the conspiracy which brought it about. That
conspiracy is perfectly well known to Lord Penshurst.
There is no justification for my arrest, and
the result of police-court proceedings must compel
me to make revelations which may prove exceedingly
awkward to his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I recognise that there must be an inquest, and
I am prepared to give evidence there. Nothing I
may say there, however, will in any way involve
the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I venture to write to you and point these things
out, and to ask you that you should immediately
communicate with Lord Penshurst by telephone,
as, although I am practically in ignorance of all
that is going on about me, I realise that some very
important matter is involved which Lord Penshurst
desires to keep to himself.&#8212;I am, yours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">James Robinson</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Westerham fastened the note down, sealed it,
and handed it to Rookley, who instructed Moore
to take it immediately to Downing Street.</p>

<p>There, Moore told Rookley afterwards, he had
the unusual experience of seeing Mr. Hilden go
pale as death, and of hearing him mutter excitedly
to himself.</p>

<p>Then the private telephone was busy for some
ten minutes, and presently Mr. Hilden came back
still greatly agitated, and told Moore to instruct
Rookley that Mr. Robinson was on no account to
be detained.</p>

<p>Both the men were, moreover, enjoined to complete
silence, and told that not a word of the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
must be breathed to anyone except the Commissioner
himself.</p>

<p>When Moore came back with these various messages,
Rookley sat for some moments as though entirely
overcome.</p>

<p>When at last he spoke his voice was husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know what it's all about, sir,&#8221; he said
to Westerham, &#8220;or who you may be. Apparently
it is none of my business to inquire; but I
tell you frankly that this beats everything that I
have ever known in the course of my long experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will naturally have to take another room,
as the body must not be touched till the police-surgeon
has seen it, when it can be removed to the
mortuary. You will get your summons for the inquest
in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom where the dead man
lay and shut the door with a bang.</p>

<p>Westerham, without even troubling to gather
together his different effects, rang the bell and ordered
another room. But, as may be imagined, he
did not sleep much; indeed, he sat and smoked
throughout the entire night, trying to account for
the real motive which underlay the murder.</p>

<p>Slowly, too, he began to see that he had underrated
Melun's resources and fiendish cleverness; for
this was evidently Melun's work.</p>

<p>Yet it was difficult to account for Melun's presence
in his club at the moment of the perpetration
of the crime. Melun must have acted with almost
superhuman swiftness and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Piecing the affair together as best he could, Westerham
came to the conclusion that after the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
had left Limehouse Melun must have purchased
Crow's adherence out and out; and this more than
ever puzzled Westerham to understand what the
amazing mystery in which he was entangled meant.
He could well believe now that the stake was even
greater than the quarter of a million the captain
himself had mentioned.</p>

<p>Then he also became convinced that not only had
he underestimated Melun's mental capacity, but
that he had underrated his physical hardihood; for
by this murder, unless he had in some subtle way
pre-armed himself with a triumphant excuse, the
captain had automatically cut himself adrift from
the rougher spirits of his gang.</p>

<p>This reflection led to a great anxiety on Westerham's
part, for he realised that if Melun could
afford to take this step the crisis must be close at
hand. And it was an exceedingly uncomfortable
and hair-raising thought when he remembered the
threat pinned to the dead man's chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl may be the next.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words haunted him more than Kathleen's
own extraordinary statement. He wondered impotently
when the problems which beset him would
cease to multiply.</p>

<p>The whole situation seemed to have a double
edge, for while he rejoiced to think that the crisis
must now be close at hand, he was correspondingly
terrified by the thought that the crisis might involve,
not only the safety, but even the life of Lady
Kathleen.</p>

<p>That he could actually blackmail the Prime
Minister to the extent of securing his immunity
from arrest only increased his alarm, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
was able thereby to appreciate more than ever the
reality of the unknown peril in which Lord Penshurst
stood.</p>

<p>It was with much apprehension that he sent for
the morning papers and read what they might have
to say concerning the tragedy.</p>

<p>Fortunately the newspapers&#8212;whether by Rookley's
instrumentality or not Westerham didn't know&#8212;were
discreet almost to the verge of being indefinite.</p>

<p>They confined themselves to setting forth those
details of the murder which could not be hidden;
they advanced no theories whatsoever, contenting
themselves by stating that the police had a clue and
that important developments might be expected.</p>

<p>They did not mention the fact that the murder
had been committed in the room occupied by a Mr.
James Robinson, but Westerham was glad to note
that they did not speculate as to who he might
be, nor did they attempt to give any account of his
present or past circumstances.</p>

<p>He was prepared to face, and if necessary to defeat,
a battery of questions when he went to the inquest.</p>

<p>The strange little coroner's court was packed to
suffocation, and Westerham was conscious that
every eye was turned upon him. But he drew some
comfort from the reflection that this was inevitable,
seeing that he was the only witness in the case beyond
the hall-porter and the detective.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found that the coroner led him
quietly through a few formal questions as to the
hour at which he arrived at the hotel and what he
had seen there. The coroner, indeed, made no attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to discover Westerham's actual identity, nor
even suggested that he should advance any theory
of the strange affair.</p>

<p>At the close of Westerham's evidence, however,
one of the jurymen became for a few moments a
little troublesome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it should be asked,&#8221; said this gentleman,
&#8220;whether Mr. Robinson's suspicions turn in any
particular direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has anything occurred in his life that would
suggest that such a crime might be looked for?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the coroner cut him short in such a freezing
manner that Westerham rightly guessed that Rookley
had been using a tactful influence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider that question,&#8221; said the coroner, &#8220;a
most improper one. We have been assured by Mr.
Rookley that there is not the slightest reason to
associate Mr. Robinson with this crime. Interference
on your part is out of place, and may even lead
to a miscarriage of justice. I am perfectly certain
that this matter may be safely left to the police,
who should be allowed to take their own course of
action.&#8221;</p>

<p>The juryman grumbled a little, but subsided, and
the sharp eyes of the reporters at the tables looked
disappointed.</p>

<p>A verdict of wilful murder by some person unknown
concluded the inquest, from which Westerham
hurried in order to evade further questionings
from curious journalists.</p>

<p>He imagined that his hotel was likely by this
time to be beset by reporters, and so, having first
acquainted Inspector Rookley with his intention,
he went back to his rooms in Bruton Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>There even the mask-like face of his valet bore
some traces of distrust and curiosity. It was, however,
without a word that the man handed him a
note.</p>

<p>To his surprise, and with a little leap of his
heart, Westerham saw that it was addressed in a
woman's hand-writing, and for a moment he
thought that the letter might be from Lady Kathleen.
But he was very roughly undeceived, for,
tearing open the envelope, his eye instantly caught
the address&#8212;&#8220;Laburnum Road, St. John's Wood&#8221;&#8212;while
across half a sheet of newspaper was
scrawled:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;For Lady Kathleen's sake, come to me at once.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Marie Estelle.</span>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class="smaller">THE GAMING-HOUSE</span></a></h2>


<p>Westerham turned the note about and about in
his fingers in the futile attempt to extract some further
information from it.</p>

<p>He realised, of course, that the note boded a new
move.</p>

<p>Had the crisis really crept so close? Or was the
danger in which Lady Kathleen stood merely
fictitious?</p>

<p>Possibly it was a trap; but that he had to risk.
One thing was certain&#8212;he could not ignore the
message.</p>

<p>On second thoughts, indeed, he was inclined to
regard the summons as a real and urgent one. The
murder at the hotel had shown him that Melun was
not the man to stick at trifles.</p>

<p>Moreover, he recollected that Madame's concern
at his becoming entangled in Melun's toils had
without question been genuine. Madame, he almost
persuaded himself, had been his friend from
the beginning. He trusted that she might be now.</p>

<p>Without any further delay, therefore, he walked
out into the quiet little street and turned in the direction
of Berkeley Square, where he knew he
would be sure to find a cab.</p>

<p>But as he emerged from the door a hansom
passed him, and without thinking, he accepted the
invitation of the driver to enter it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the trap-door he told the man to drive
to the Laburnum Road; and then as the vehicle
moved along at a smart pace he gave himself up
again to speculating in what way Kathleen might
be in peril and from what motive Mme. Estelle had
warned him.</p>

<p>He had come to no conclusion on this point when
the hansom swung sharply round from the Finchley
Road into Laburnum Road, which at that hour
of the day was more quiet and deserted than ever.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened so suddenly that
he had no time to ward off the danger in which he
found himself.</p>

<p>Two steel arms, which had been so secreted in
the upholstery of the cab as to be invisible, suddenly
closed round his arms and body with a snap,
and as the hansom was pulled up with a jerk he
found himself a prisoner, so tightly squeezed by the
encircling steel arms that he was unable to do more
than wriggle in his seat.</p>

<p>In a moment the driver was off the dicky and
had come round to the front of the cab. With a
fascinated gaze Westerham watched him take a
little phial from his pocket and saturate a handkerchief.</p>

<p>He divined the man's intention in a moment, and
cried out an inquiry as to what he was about to do.</p>

<p>But the man made no answer, except to grin
and climb on to the step of the cab.</p>

<p>A moment later he had clapped the handkerchief
over Westerham's mouth and nose and held it there
tightly for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Westerham was alike unable to struggle or cry
out. For a few moments he fought against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
overpowering odour of chloroform; then his vision
grew dim, his ears began to sing, and he lapsed into
complete unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was to find himself fully
dressed and stretched upon a sofa. It was apparently
morning-time, for the table close beside him
was laid out as though for breakfast, and a flood
of early sunshine was pouring in through the open
French windows.</p>

<p>He was so astonished at his whereabouts that
he closed his eyes again and endeavoured with a
still half-numbed brain to call to mind the events
which had brought him into such strange surroundings.</p>

<p>Slowly, stupidly, he began to remember Mme.
Estelle's letter and his disastrous drive in the cab.
But so dazed was he that he had for the purpose
of fully arousing his faculties actually to repeat his
name and address several times before his senses
began to assume their normal condition of alertness.</p>

<p>When his brain was clearer he endeavoured to
rise, but he immediately became dizzy again and
sank back on the couch as though exhausted by a
long illness.</p>

<p>So complete was the blank between the time he
had been chloroformed and his awaking that he
had not the faintest idea whether he had lain on
the couch on which he found himself for hours or
days, or even weeks.</p>

<p>Yesterday seemed to be a long time behind him.</p>

<p>So, finding exertion out of the question, he leant
back with almost contentment among the pillows,
and fell to wondering in whose house he might be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
From the shape of the room and the aspect of the
garden more than anything he came to the conclusion
that the roof which sheltered him was that
of Mme. Estelle. On this point, however, he could
not quite make up his mind until the door opened
softly and Mme. Estelle herself came into the
room.</p>

<p>She walked over to the couch and stood looking
down at him pleasantly and kindly.</p>

<p>Westerham was so astonished at her appearance
that he could say nothing at all.</p>

<p>It was Madame who spoke first, but before doing
so she drew a chair to his side and sat down.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Paul, I owe you a deep apology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham contented himself with a slight inclination
of his weary head, and waited for Madame
to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can speak quite frankly now,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;knowing that there is no one about to overhear,
and I must begin by asking you to forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham nodded, but still said nothing, though
now he saw plainly enough that the letter had
merely been a blind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; Madame continued, turning her face
away from him, &#8220;it was not so great a lie. Lady
Kathleen was in peril, and is still in peril, but not
in the peril which I really imagined at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>Madame glanced uneasily about her, and then
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you, my friend. I wish I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was in peril, is still in peril, but not in the
peril in which she was,&#8221; Westerham repeated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
himself. He removed his puzzled gaze from the
woman's face and glanced at his feet.</p>

<p>Then he started violently, for the boots which
he wore, comfortable though they were, were not
his boots.</p>

<p>Struggling into a half-sitting posture, he looked
hastily over his clothes. They were not his clothes.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to rise and Madame helped him
to his feet. On one side he supported himself by
the table, and on the other by Madame's arm.</p>

<p>Then he took a step forward and deliberately
surveyed himself in the glass. And his look of inspection
filled him with intense surprise, though he
did not allow himself to so much as utter an exclamation.</p>

<p>Mechanically he began to employ those little
tricks of gesture which a man indulges in when he
is anxious to ascertain if his clothes sit well on him.</p>

<p>To his amazement not one article of attire was
his own; yet the blue serge suit in which he was
clad was of such a perfect fit that he might have
been moulded into it. He moved his toes inside his
boot and found that of all the boots he had ever
worn these were the most comfortable.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his tie and found that his
collar was the exact size. Quickly and methodically
he searched through his pockets; his handkerchief
was where he always carried it; his keys were in his
left trouser pocket; his money and knife in his
right. Each in its own correct waistcoat pocket he
found his nail clippers, his sovereign purse and tiny
card-case. His cards were intact.</p>

<p>Plunging his hand into the inner pocket of his
coat he discovered that his notebook was in its place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Almost instinctively he opened it and turned over
the contents; nothing whatsoever had been disturbed.</p>

<p>So utterly dumfounded was he that he sat down
heavily again upon the couch and stared at Mme.
Estelle.</p>

<p>Madame laughed, showing her fine teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a little puzzled,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I was never so puzzled
in my life. Can you tell me what it all
means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would that I were able,&#8221; said Madame, earnestly,
&#8220;but it is quite impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These things,&#8221; urged Westerham, stretching out
his limbs, &#8220;what is the meaning of it? I can quite
understand,&#8221; he added bitterly, &#8220;that it might be
necessary for Melun to chloroform me for various
reasons, but one of those reasons was apparently
not theft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; he added, with a wry smile, &#8220;the
captain seems to have been spending money on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he cried, starting up and then falling
back weakly, &#8220;tell me what all this means. I have
had my fill of mystery during the last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think,&#8221; suggested Madame, quietly,
&#8220;that it would be best to begin at the beginning?
Surely it would be more reasonable for you to
ask why you were chloroformed and brought
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;why was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was done,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle, &#8220;because it
was necessary to make you a prisoner for nearly
thirty hours&#8212;and it was the only way to do it.
You see,&#8221; she added lightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> &#8220;you are a strong man,
and I don't blame Melun for declining to risk a
struggle with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don't understand any better now,&#8221; Westerham
complained, passing his hand across his
forehead. &#8220;Why should I be made a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle touched his arm and looked earnestly
into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;it was necessary
to ensure that you should see Lady Kathleen to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see Lady Kathleen to-night,&#8221; cried Westerham.
&#8220;When and where? Not here, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Madame, with a little smile,
&#8220;not here, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Events,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;have taken a very sudden
and curious turn. Yesterday, I tell you
frankly, your own life was in considerable danger.
You may think it very cold-blooded and horrible of
me to say such a thing, but I know that Melun had
practically come to the conclusion that you must
be put out of the way in order to save trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was averse to that, and, thanks to the
plan I suggested, it was found unnecessary to do
you any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; urged Westerham, &#8220;was it found
necessary to play all these tricks with my clothes?
Why, they must have been made from extremely
careful measurements. I should say they had been
modelled on one of my own suits. And the boots
are the strangest part of all&#8212;they fit me like
gloves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was intended they should,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
&#8220;And be thankful that they do, for though
it is impossible for me to explain, they have actually
saved you from death. I assure you that there is
no man this afternoon more jealous of your safety
than Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lady Kathleen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle, gravely,
&#8220;is still in great danger&#8212;but it is a danger of a
different kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't mean to tell me,&#8221; cried Westerham,
&#8220;that whereas my life has been spared hers is not
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221; cried Westerham. &#8220;But this
is monstrous&#8212;perfectly monstrous! What does all
this juggling mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don't excite yourself, Sir Paul!&#8221; said
Mme. Estelle. &#8220;It can do no good. Believe me
that I bear Lady Kathleen no ill-will, and that if I
can save her I will do so, even at the cost of being
a little disloyal to Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why all this trickery and mystery?&#8221; demanded
Westerham again. &#8220;It almost amounts
to tomfoolery. One would think that Melun had
gone crazy and was indulging in some mad whim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is a whim, but it is a whim with a
very serious motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she added, &#8220;let's try to get some breakfast.
I promise you that if you will only endeavour
to get strong during the day you shall certainly see
Lady Kathleen to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> &#8220;I don't know. I
can only guess. It was not my business to ask
questions on that point. The cab will call for you
to-night at nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cab!&#8221; exclaimed Westerham. &#8220;Do you
mean the same vehicle which brought me here?
For if you mean that then I decline to travel in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I fear,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle, sharply, &#8220;you
will have to forego the satisfaction of seeing Lady
Kathleen. The cab will be your only means of
reaching her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me,&#8221; demanded Westerham,
who had been so unnerved by the chloroform
as to become a little excited, &#8220;do you mean that
I am a prisoner in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only so far as your feelings keep you captive,&#8221;
was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know what your feelings will say. They
will decide that you must wait here in patience until
the hour comes for you to go to Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham said no more; it was idle to argue
with this woman. Circumstances were too strong
and strange for him.</p>

<p>After breakfast he revived considerably, and
Madame left him on the couch with a pile of magazines
to amuse him.</p>

<p>Lunch was served at one, and the afternoon
dragged slowly and painfully away. It was with
great impatience that Westerham watched the table
being leisurely and neatly laid for dinner. His
irritation grew with every passing minute.</p>

<p>At dinner he ate but little and drank less, though
Madame pleaded that a second glass of champagne
would go far to steady his considerably shaken
nerves.</p>

<p>Westerham, however, declined. He had become
so suspicious of everybody and everything he half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
imagined that, not content with chloroforming him,
his captors might attempt to drug him also.</p>

<p>At the stroke of nine Westerham heard the rumble
of wheels in the street, and, rising from the
table, Mme. Estelle informed him that the cab had
arrived.</p>

<p>As they stood in the hall the woman held out her
hand and Westerham put out his half-way to meet
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall certainly require
an explanation of all these strange doings. In the
meantime, I don't think you should take my hand
unless you are sincere in your determination to reduce
Lady Kathleen's danger in every way you
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; declared Madame, most earnestly,
&#8220;that I am quite sincere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham shook her by the hand.</p>

<p>It was not until the cab was bowling along Oxford
Street that Westerham began to look about
him. He had no idea of his destination, and he
considered that it would be just as well to take
careful note of the journey.</p>

<p>Half-way between Oxford Circus and the Tottenham
Court Road the cab turned up to the left.
Peering through the glass, Westerham could just
make out Newman Street. At the bottom of the
street the cab turned to the left, then to the right
again, then to the left, and once more to the right.
So far as he could tell, Westerham gathered that
he must now be parallel to the top of Tottenham
Court Road, and be a good deal nearer to Portman
Street than Oxford Street.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cab drew up with a jingle and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
clatter, and the driver, lifting the trap-door, informed
Westerham that he had reached his destination.</p>

<p>Upon this Westerham stepped out to find himself
in a narrow, shabby, and almost deserted
thoroughfare of mean and hang-dog appearance.</p>

<p>In spite of this he recognised that the houses
must once have been the dwellings of well-to-do
people, for the railings about the areas were of
finely-wrought iron and the doors were high and
massive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knock three single knocks,&#8221; said the cab-driver
into his ear, and then jumping on to the dicky the
man drove away.</p>

<p>Suddenly Westerham remembered that there was
one pocket of his new clothes which he had not
searched. His hand went towards his hip, and he
was surprised to find that his revolver was without
question there.</p>

<p>Glancing about to make sure that he was not observed,
Westerham drew it out and felt with his
thumb along the back barrels. It was still loaded.
For a second Westerham wondered whether the
bullets had been drawn, but, opening the six-shooter,
he satisfied himself that the cartridges had not been
tampered with.</p>

<p>This amazed him not a little, although the discovery
considerably restored his confidence. At
least he had to anticipate no further attack on that
night.</p>

<p>And then he remembered the mysterious words
of Mme. Estelle: &#8220;No man now is more jealous
of your safety than Captain Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not help pondering on this point as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
gave three taps with the heavy old-fashioned
knocker.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a man, apparently a
German, dressed in the black coat and white shirt
of the traditional English butler.</p>

<p>He said something to him in a foreign tongue
which Westerham could not understand. His gesture,
however, was clear enough, and he walked
straight ahead down a dimly-lighted passage till he
came to a baize door. This the man pushed open
for him, and he passed on alone, and heard a bolt
drawn behind him.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt as to the way
he had to go. There was no other exit from the
place except a flight of stone steps, which led downwards.
At the bottom of the flight of steps there
was a second baize door, and through this Westerham
passed along a well-carpeted corridor faintly
lit by electric light. The passage had no windows,
and it suddenly struck Westerham that he was underground.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor Westerham encountered
another baize door, but as he stepped on the
mat which was laid before it he heard an electric
bell ring sharply, and the door opened itself.</p>

<p>As it did so Westerham was almost blinded by
a flood of white light.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood quite still, blinking and
endeavouring to take in the scene. But it was the
sound of it rather than the sight of it which instantly
told him of the manner of the place in which
he stood. He heard the monotonous cry of croupiers
and the sharp click of a ricochetting roulette
ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>He was most unquestionably in a gambling-hell.</p>

<p>That in itself did not disturb him in the least,
and as his eyes grew accustomed to the light he
stepped forward into the room, only to stand still
again and remain motionless, as though turned to
stone.</p>

<p>For there, at a long table in the centre of the
room, with piles of gold and notes before her, sat
Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>A little cry which Westerham could not prevent
breaking from his lips drew the eyes of all upon
him. Lady Kathleen glanced up, and catching his
gaze upon her turned as pale as death.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class="smaller">LADY KATHLEEN'S MISSION</span></a></h2>


<p>In spite of Mme. Estelle's declaration that he
should see Lady Kathleen that night, and in spite
of the conviction that Madame spoke the truth,
Westerham, strange to say, had not expected to
find her in the gaming-house.</p>

<p>As he entered the room of lights he had for a
moment wondered for what reason he had been
brought into such a place, but at the same time, by
some swift mental process, he had decided that the
mysterious gaming-house was but a step towards
Lady Kathleen, and not the actual place in which
he was to meet her.</p>

<p>For once his intuition had played him false and
he was correspondingly taken aback. The deathly
pallor, however, which had spread across Kathleen's
face served to bring him to a swift realisation of
the situation. It was imperative that there should
be no scene; matters then would be doubly painful.</p>

<p>Westerham, therefore, instantly turned away and
endeavoured to hide himself amid the odd jumble
of men who stood round the table watching the
play.</p>

<p>The chloroform still hung heavy in Westerham's
brain, and at first he was quite unable to get any
connected trend of thought. But presently his mental
vision became clearer, and he was able to appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the extraordinary succession of events which
had led up to this climax.</p>

<p>Melun he had not seen since the night of the
atrocious murder at Walter's Hotel&#8212;and therefore
he had been unable to extract from him any information
of that villainous and apparently purposeless
deed.</p>

<p>For what motive Melun might have in instigating
such a crime, except it were to frighten him from
his championship of Lady Kathleen, Westerham
could not say. Then had followed his extraordinary
adventure in the hansom cab and Madame's
enigmatic utterances when he recovered his senses
in the morning.</p>

<p>And if the motive of the murder were obscure,
the motive which induced Melun and his accomplices
to change his clothes while drugged was
doubly hidden.</p>

<p>What, moreover, could be the motive in bringing
him to behold Lady Kathleen in this gaming-house?</p>

<p>This last problem troubled him more than the
others, and he gave himself up to considering it as
he crouched down seeking to hide himself in the
midst of the motley crowd which swayed and jostled
round the tables.</p>

<p>Even as he debated this question with himself
he took note of the men who hemmed the table in.
Every type of face presented itself&#8212;the fleshy
cheeks of middle-aged Jews, of pale clerks and
salesmen, prosperous-looking men who might have
been commercial travellers, and here and there a
more refined-looking man in evening-dress.</p>

<p>A few were still playing, but the majority were
watching the play of Lady Kathleen, and it dawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
on Westerham that she was waging a losing fight
with the bank.</p>

<p>Her face and figure were in extraordinary contrast
to her surroundings. She was, besides, the
only woman in the room.</p>

<p>Draped in a long opera cloak from which her
bare arms were thrust, she sat forward eagerly in
her chair, her lips trembling, her eyes bright as
stars.</p>

<p>On either side of her sat a sturdy and rather
roughly-dressed man, who took no part in the play.
Westerham imagined that they were employees of
Melun, stationed there for the purpose of ensuring
Lady Kathleen against any molestation or insult.</p>

<p>Such a protection was entirely unnecessary, for
every man in the room appeared to feel that he was
in the presence of one who not only had the right,
but the power, to command respect. In spite of her
incongruous surroundings, and in spite of her extraordinary
occupation of the moment, the coarse faces
by which she was surrounded surveyed her with a
certain marked and almost sheepish deference.</p>

<p>As the game went on and the croupier monotonously
raked in the winnings of the bank, Westerham
suddenly divined the motive which had induced
Melun to send him there to watch Lady Kathleen
play.</p>

<p>He did not know why she played, nor what the
real stake might be, but one thing was obvious&#8212;that
after he entered the room and she had caught
sight of his face her luck suddenly changed. She
had been greatly alarmed and distressed; so disconcerted,
indeed, that for a few minutes she apparently
lost all track of the successful theory which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
she had been following. And Westerham knew
well enough that if a good player once becomes
unnerved, his luck, for some strange reason, will
change with his mood, and no efforts, however bold
or desperate, will avail him anything.</p>

<p>It amazed Westerham beyond measure that Lady
Kathleen could play such a game with so consummate
a skill and so much evidence of experience.
He judged that her father at some time or other
had let her have a little fling at Monte Carlo, and
that profiting by such knowledge as she had acquired
there she had now been playing an inspired
game for some incalculable stake.</p>

<p>Westerham imagined, too, that it had probably
been Melun's brutal fancy to drag the girl there on
the promise that if she won against the bank he
would release her father from his torment; no other
theory was possible.</p>

<p>And it made his heart grow cold with rage as
he appreciated the fiendish cleverness with which
Melun had engineered his entrance at a critical moment.
Westerham had been made the innocent
instrument of utter disaster to Kathleen.</p>

<p>So convinced did he become of this fact that he
shouldered his way through the crowd, and leaning
over Lady Kathleen's chair, whispered into her ear:
&#8220;Don't be alarmed. I see you have been greatly
upset. Please allow me to assist you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man at her right hand scowled angrily, but
Westerham turned to him with an urbane smile.
&#8220;As you do not seem to be playing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;perhaps
you will allow me to have your chair?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor had the man any option but to vacate his
seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Westerham's spirits rose as for the first time in
his life he found himself seated by Kathleen's
side, playing on her behalf, to win a desperate
game.</p>

<p>But the girl's inspiration was gone, and even his
skill at this form of gambling availed him nothing.
Time after time they lost until practically nothing
remained of the great pile of money which had been
stacked on the table before Lady Kathleen when he
had entered the room.</p>

<p>The girl watched the money dwindle with terrified
eyes, her face growing paler and paler until
it was ashy white.</p>

<p>Westerham sought to console her. &#8220;Don't despair,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;I think I have enough with
me to see us through.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had at first sat down to assist her she
had stared at him with considerable astonishment.
Now she appeared utterly confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand,&#8221; she said in a low voice.
&#8220;You have certainly done your best to help me, but
I cannot see why you wish me to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham turned and looked her full in the
eyes. &#8220;How long will it be?&#8221; he asked in a low
voice, &#8220;before you come to trust me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand into his breast-pocket to take
out the notes which he had assured himself had not
been removed while he lay insensible at Mme.
Estelle's.</p>

<p>The notes were gone.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to help uttering an
exclamation which drew Kathleen's attention to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been robbed,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>With a little sob Lady Kathleen rose from the
table and steadied herself with her hands on the
back of her chair.</p>

<p>At the same moment the door by which Westerham
had entered opened again, and there came in
two gentlemen in evening-dress. A third man followed
close behind them, and a rush of angry blood
crept up the back of Westerham's neck as he recognised
Melun.</p>

<p>The room was quite hushed. The men about the
table had been awed by the vast sum of money
which the mysterious lady had staked and lost.</p>

<p>As she moved a step forward as though to go
they drew aside to give her free passage, so that
now she found herself face to face with the men
who had just entered.</p>

<p>Looking over Lady Kathleen's head, Westerham
saw the two men glance quickly at each other, their
faces a complete study in well-bred astonishment.
They bowed to Lady Kathleen, but said nothing.
It was Melun who brushed by them and spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a most unfortunate meeting,&#8221; he said
to Lady Kathleen, &#8220;and as a friend of your father
I would suggest that nothing should be discussed
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; stammered Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing!&#8221; said Melun, hastily, &#8220;except
that this is no fit place for you to remain in.
Allow me to show you the way out at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham thrust himself between Kathleen and
the two men who had entered with Melun, and
spoke to him in a low, fierce voice that could not
be heard by the girl, but was perfectly audible to
the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you, you miserable hypocrite,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;she will leave this place at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun waved his hand at him blandly. &#8220;Quite
so,&#8221; he said, &#8220;quite so. We will have a little talk
outside, but there is no reason why we should distress
these gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; returned Westerham, &#8220;there
is every reason. Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, stepping up
to the strangers, &#8220;I can see that you are well acquainted
with this lady, who unfortunately came
here without my knowledge, but whom I now regard
as under my protection. The situation is, of
course, extraordinary, and requires some explanation.
If you will be so good, I shall be glad of your
company for a few moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more ado he pushed the baize-covered
door open and first bowed Lady Kathleen out.
Melun followed, nervous and ill at ease. He had
not looked for so much determination on the part
of Westerham.</p>

<p>The two men in evening-dress glanced at each
other again, and then passed out before Westerham
as he held the door open for them.</p>

<p>When the little party was grouped in the dimly-lit
passage Westerham went over to Kathleen and
touched her lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen,&#8221; he said, in a formal voice,
&#8220;you will greatly oblige me by stepping to the
other end of the passage. I have something to say
to these gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Making a little inclination with her head, Lady
Kathleen walked slowly away from them, leaving
Westerham to confront Melun. And Westerham
by no means minced matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Of you,&#8221; he said in a voice full of scorn, &#8220;I
will demand an explanation by-and-by. Your motive
in dragging Lady Kathleen here is sufficiently
obvious to me, but is probably not understood by
these gentlemen, whom you have carefully brought
to witness her humiliation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun would have protested but Westerham cut
him short.</p>

<p>Westerham took out his card-case and offered a
card to one of the men in evening-dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; he said, with a rather bitter little
smile, &#8220;will probably convey nothing to you. If,
however, you wish to know on what authority I
speak, kindly communicate with Lord Dunton,
whom you doubtless know. He will assure you
that I am entirely to be trusted, and that the favour
I am about to ask of you is fully justified.</p>

<p>&#8220;For purposes of his own, this individual&#8221;&#8212;he
indicated Melun&#8212;&#8220;has brought Lady Kathleen here
for apparently no other reason in the world than
that her good name may be connected with a most
unpleasant scandal. Believe me or not as you
please, I can only assure you that Lady Kathleen
was brought here against her will. Unpleasant
though these surroundings may be, they are unfortunately
connected&#8212;intimately connected&#8212;with
Lord Penshurst's affairs. I ask you on his behalf,
and on that of his daughter, to give me your word
that what you have seen shall go no further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder man looked at Westerham shrewdly
and made a little bow. He liked the honesty of his
face and the complete contempt with which he
treated Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honour,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> &#8220;and
I make myself chargeable for my friend as well,
that until we hear from you further on this matter
we will make no mention of it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having said this, he made a little bow and drew
away, as though to end an awkward situation. The
younger man bowed and did the same.</p>

<p>Westerham thereupon walked to the end of the
passage, where Lady Kathleen waited for him,
Melun following hard upon his footsteps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Westerham, facing about
once more, &#8220;but your assistance is not required.
You will be kind enough to call on me at Walter's
to-morrow morning, when I shall ask you for an
explanation of many things. Till then I have no
further need of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen listened to this curt speech of
Westerham's in an indifferent way, as though all
her senses were partially numbed. Still she gave
him a quick little look that was not only a glance of
gratitude, but a look of inquiry. Plainly she herself
was puzzled by the attitude Westerham adopted
towards the captain.</p>

<p>However, she said nothing at all, nor did she attempt
to break the silence till the cab in which Westerham
drove her back to Downing Street was
drawing close to Whitehall.</p>

<p>Then, as she appeared to speak with a great
effort, turning her face towards Westerham and
peering at him as though endeavouring to read his
thoughts, she thanked him for his intervention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robinson,&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> &#8220;I am profoundly
grateful for all that you have done, though I confess
I cannot understand it at all. If you speak to
Melun in that way you must be his master, and if
you are his master it may in reality have been you
who dragged me to that place to-night to pit my
poor little skill against Melun's bank for the sake
of my father's honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid that I should do such a thing,&#8221;
cried Westerham, fervently, &#8220;and Heaven forbid
that you should believe me capable of any such
villainy! I suspected that you had been drawn there
on some such pretext, but I assure you that I knew
nothing of it. It is impossible for me to explain
now what has happened since I saw you last. I
can only tell you that I have been almost as badly
treated as yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke Lady Kathleen drew away from
him with a slight shudder, as though some recollection
had suddenly come back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The murder,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what of that? I
am told that it happened in your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am innocent of it in every way,&#8221; said Westerham,
earnestly. &#8220;Indeed, I have not yet discovered
the motive of such a dastardly act. I can, however,
make a guess, and the guess fills me with apprehension
just as much for my safety as for yours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you not relent,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and make
a confidant of me? Believe me that it is within
my power to help you, and that I will gladly serve
you in any way that you choose to dictate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a little sob. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;don't distress me any further. It is not
my secret but my father's&#8212;besides, I am not sure
that you do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham thrust up the trap and ordered the
cabman to stop.</p>

<p>When he had stepped out he turned back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
leant towards Kathleen. &#8220;You do me a great
wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But believe me, you cannot
possibly fight for ever against my determination to
serve you. I am told that the crisis is approaching.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no notion what the words meant, but he
desired to watch their effect, and again he saw
Lady Kathleen's face blanch.</p>

<p>She stretched out both her hands as though to
ward off a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;How near is it?&#8221; she asked in a faint voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows,&#8221; answered Westerham, &#8220;and
it is quite impossible for me to help you unless you
will tell me everything. When you need me, send
for me at Walter's Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Kathleen shuddered, and the cab drove
on, leaving Westerham standing alone on the pavement
lost in sorrowful thought.</p>

<p>At Walter's he was received most ungraciously.
He had not been back there since the night of the
murder, and his absence had caused great distrust.
Though Inspector Rookley had informed the manager
that no suspicion attached to his guest, Mr.
Robinson, his words hardly coincided with the presence
of the younger detective, who, having taken a
room there, never left the premises.</p>

<p>Immediately on Westerham's return he communicated
with his chief, and in half an hour Rookley
came round from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He sent his name up to Westerham and Westerham
judged it as well to see the man at once. The
inspector came up to the little sitting-room looking
grave and anxious. He also seemed a trifle nervous
at broaching the subject of Westerham's
absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Really, you know, Mr. Robinson,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you are hardly going the way to give us any confidence
in you. Of course, I know that you have
great influence at your back, but what the Prime
Minister may care to do does not altogether affect
us. It is quite possible that some of those who
occupy high places may be mistaken, and it is as
much for Lord Penshurst's protection as for our
own that we are compelled to keep you &#8216;under
observation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have escaped once, but you may not escape
so easily a second time, and I must warn you that
these disappearances of yours have to be notified to
the Commissioner himself. He is very much
alarmed at the whole course of events, and is determined
to take action in spite of Lord Penshurst's
protestations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That seems to me,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;an
unwise thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective grew a trifle alarmed. What he
had said was only partially true, and he felt that
he had gone too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't misunderstand me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of
course, within reason, we are bound to respect Lord
Penshurst's wishes, but Scotland Yard is not a
political association; it is a police force, and if we
find crime being introduced into politics it is certainly
our business to inquire into the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand you to suggest that Lord Penshurst
would dabble in crime?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>The detective threw up his hands in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; he said vehemently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> &#8220;Certainly
not! It is you we still suspect, not Lord
Penshurst. Good gracious! Certainly not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You suspect me, I presume, to such an extent,&#8221;
replied Westerham, &#8220;that if I left this hotel I am
pretty sure to be followed. Well, follow me,&#8221; he
added with a laugh, &#8220;and catch me if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>And taking up his hat he walked out.</p>

<p>He was perfectly right in his suspicions, and as
he moved down the Strand and looked into the
shop windows he was conscious that a bulky man
dogged his footsteps. The pursuit, however, rather
sharpened Westerham's wits than otherwise, and
raised his spirits rather than depressed them. It
served to take his thoughts from the grim business
which was beginning to weigh him down.</p>

<p>Westerham's notions of evading capture were
somewhat immature, as it was a new experience
for him to find the police constantly upon his track.
Very little ingenuity, however, sufficed to rid him,
at least for a time, of his pursuers.</p>

<p>He strolled along Piccadilly and up the Burlington
Arcade.</p>

<p>He entered Truefit's, where he made a small and
totally unnecessary purchase.</p>

<p>By this move he knew that he placed the detective
who followed him in an awkward position.</p>

<p>He was conscious that the man's face was pressed
against the glass in an endeavour to keep him in
sight. He did not enter the shop from the very
obvious fear of becoming too obtrusive.</p>

<p>Westerham sauntered down the shop, and then,
before the detective had any chance of making even
an attempt at pursuit, he slipped out into Bond
Street and clambered on to a passing omnibus.</p>

<p>As the heavy vehicle lumbered past the clubs in
Piccadilly, Westerham took a long breath of relief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and startled the other passengers by laughing aloud.
He went on to Victoria, where he made several
purchases, including a second-hand kit-bag.</p>

<p>Armed with this, he walked boldly into the Buckingham
Palace Hotel and there booked a room.</p>

<p>Immediately after this he wrote a note to Lord
Dunton, asking him to call at once, for he was
anxious that he should be warned in time of the
visit the two men he had met at the gaming-house
the night before would surely pay him.</p>

<p>Little by little Westerham had begun to confide
in Dunton. For in spite of that youthful nobleman's
apparent flightiness he was, as a matter
of fact, discretion itself and a very tomb for
secrets.</p>

<p>To his dismay, however, the messenger-boy
whom he had dispatched with the note returned
with word that Lord Dunton had a couple of days
before run over to Paris, and that he was not expected
back till the following afternoon.</p>

<p>This landed Westerham in a particularly awkward
predicament. It was imperative that he
should see Melun as soon as possible, if only for
the purpose of threatening to give him into charge
for murder. It was only, too, from Melun that he
was likely to hear any news of Lady Kathleen
until Dunton returned to help him out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should he send for Melun,
Melun was shrewd enough to warn the police
at once of Westerham's whereabouts. And this, as
his complete freedom of movement might become
absolutely necessary, Westerham could not afford
to risk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-four hours, then, he remained in the
hotel, chafing against the delay, and pacing the
floor of his room hour by hour in a vain endeavour
to unravel the tangled skein of mystery in which
he was enmeshed.</p>

<p>On the following day, as Dunton had not arrived
by four o'clock, Westerham sent round to his rooms
again, only to receive the heart-breaking news that
Dunton was still absent. He despatched a further
and yet more urgent message to Dunton's rooms,
and sat down to wait again.</p>

<p>It was half-past seven when Dunton leisurely
descended from a hansom and strolled up the steps
of the hotel.</p>

<p>Westerham almost rushed forward to meet him,
and grasping him by the arm dragged him into the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>There he made as complete a statement as he
dared of all that had happened in the past two days;
and Lord Dunton opened his innocent-looking blue
eyes very wide indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; he said from time to time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not tell you all this,&#8221; Westerham concluded,
&#8220;unless I were absolutely certain that I
could trust you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no idea who the men were that I saw at
the Faro Club, but I don't suppose that it will be
long before they call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that they have called already,&#8221; said
Dunton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> &#8220;When I got back this afternoon I found
that cards had been left by Lord Cuckfield and a
chap by the name of Mendip. My man said that
they came together, so I presume they are the
Johnnies you mean. And I won't let the grass
grow under my feet. I'll look them up to-night
and tell them that they have got to keep their
mouths shut and to take you on trust.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; added Dunton, &#8220;this business
seems to grow &#8216;curiouser and curiouser&#8217; as Alice
would say. I should have been back before but
some unaccountable inclination made me break my
journey at Rouen. I was there this afternoon, and
who should I see but the heroine of all this
mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; shouted Westerham, utterly shaken
out of himself, &#8220;not Lady Kathleen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen herself,&#8221; answered Dunton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; cried Westerham. &#8220;The crisis
must be at hand indeed. She has been lured over
there to her death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunton dropped his eyeglass and stared at his
friend in amazement. Westerham was almost beside
himself with anxiety and rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't sit staring there like a gibbering idiot,&#8221;
he almost yelled, &#8220;but give me some money.
Quick! They have taken my notes, and I have
practically spent all my loose cash on the things I
need here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunton began to fumble in his pockets. &#8220;You
cannot expect a fellow to have much about him
when he has just come back from Paris,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;Still, I think I can dig up twenty pounds
or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham stood over him. &#8220;Come along!
Come along!&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Every penny you have
got.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a queer smile Dunton emptied his pockets
and poured the contents into Westerham's palms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;All right! All right!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don't be
in such a hurry. It's most disturbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; cried Westerham again. &#8220;Don't
you understand that I have only ten minutes in
which to catch the boat-train?&#8221;</p>

<p>And without another word he bolted out of the
room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br /><span class="smaller">BY ORDER OF THE CZAR</span></a></h2>


<p>Swift as the cab was, Westerham only caught the
boat-train by a minute, and at that without a ticket.</p>

<p>He had then two hours for calm reflection, and to
some extent self-reproach. Never in his life before
had he been so unnerved, and the expressions of irritation
which he had made at the Buckingham
Palace Hotel before Dunton did not seem to him
good.</p>

<p>He saw that his was not a fit state of mind to be
in if he intended to steer safely through the troubled
waters ahead of him.</p>

<p>Some things were growing clearer to his mind.
More and more he was coming to realise the clever,
if circuitous, means by which Melun was seeking to
break down Lady Kathleen's resistance and render
his own task harder.</p>

<p>But this new move disturbed him more than any
which had yet been made. He could find no reason
for the scene of the conflict being suddenly transferred
from England to France, unless, indeed,
Melun had at last come to the conclusion that Westerham
was too dangerous a man to play with.</p>

<p>Soon he saw, however, that speculation was utterly
useless. All his efforts must be concentrated
upon his finding Lady Kathleen, and if necessary
compelling her by sheer force to capitulate and take
him into her confidence.</p>

<p>He set his heart upon this so strongly that he persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
himself that there were no difficulties in his
way. It would be strange indeed if, when the moment
came, he would not be able to induce Lady
Kathleen to reveal those things which up to then she
had so obstinately and persistently hid.</p>

<p>The night was calm, and the passage to Dieppe a
smooth one, but on the quay Westerham received a
sharp demonstration that the difficulties which he
had mentally brushed aside nevertheless remained to
be grappled with in actual fact.</p>

<p>To begin with, he had no luggage. He did not
even possess an overcoat, and as it had come on to
rain, and for the sake of greater freedom of thought
he had remained on deck, his appearance was already
travel-worn and bedraggled.</p>

<p>Small wonder, therefore, that as he presented the
ticket with which he had been provided at Newhaven
the officials of the <i>douane</i> regarded him with
keen suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur has nothing to declare?&#8221; they asked.</p>

<p>He could only shrug his shoulders and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Absolutely nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>To avoid further questionings he added: &#8220;I
have not even an overcoat.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked him up and down, and his appearance
inspired a certain amount of respect. None
the less, they took counsel together, and with an
ever-watchful eye Westerham saw them approach
a portly person of an intensely British aspect.</p>

<p>Presently this individual came up to him and
asked in most unmistakably English terms what
Westerham's destination might be.</p>

<p>Westerham told the man shortly that his destination
was Rouen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me, sir,&#8221; said the man, whom
Westerham guessed to be a Scotland Yard representative
at the port of Dieppe, &#8220;but it is rather
unusual for gentlemen to travel without luggage
and without even so much as an overcoat. It is
even more curious,&#8221; he added, &#8220;when they start on
a journey without first taking a ticket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham surveyed the man coolly with a
faintly insolent air. He was coming to realise that
whereas in ordinary times the consciousness of his
own good faith enabled him to pass every barrier
with the superiority born of an easy conscience, it
required some brazenness to face obstructions of
this sort when he had a desire for secrecy.</p>

<p>And the fat man was evidently shrewd. He
might take life easily on the quay, and watch with
thoughtful and even drowsy eyes the coming and
going of innumerable English voyagers, but for all
that his alertness only slept, and though he had an
instinctive trust of Westerham's face and manner,
still he could not deny that appearances were
against the Englishman who travelled so unprovided
for a journey and with such evident haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said apologetically, &#8220;you will
excuse my being persistent in making inquiries, for,
after all, that is only my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Westerham, with a genial smile,
&#8220;and how can I help you to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>With some pomposity of manner the English detective
produced a fat note-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm afraid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I must ask you to
give me your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham smiled a little to himself to think
how futile was such a precaution on the man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
part. He was at liberty to give him what name he
chose; he could give him the first name that came
into his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;that for safety's sake
you had better call me Charles Grey, though how
on earth you are to ascertain whether that is my
real name or not I confess I cannot see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat detective sucked in his lips and wrote the
name laboriously in his book.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said, with some asperity, &#8220;people
who give wrong names and addresses seldom come
to any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; said Westerham, and walked a
little moodily towards the train. He paid the
guard handsomely enough to warrant the man's not
forgetting to call him at Rouen. But still Westerham
felt that he had so much at stake that he could
leave nothing to chance, and so he sat upright,
wakeful and watchful, while the train rushed
through the apple trees of Normandy to the old
cathedral city.</p>

<p>When he arrived there it was raining hard, and
he was conscious that he was again an object of suspicion
as he stood on the steps of the station looking
about him in search of a <i>fiacre</i>.</p>

<p>No vehicle was in sight, and Westerham set himself
to tramp up the hill to the Hôtel de la Cloche,
at which he had stayed long years before, and of
which he still entertained a lively recollection of its
cleanness and its quaintness.</p>

<p>The hotel slept, and Westerham heard the bell
pealing through the silent house as he stood shivering
and waiting on the doorstep.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the sound of bolts being withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and a shock-headed night porter thrust his
face out into the damp morning air.</p>

<p>The sight of Westerham's tall figure drew his
immediate attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does Monsieur require?&#8221; he asked in
accents which were at once civil and surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me in,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;and I will do
my best to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man switched on the electric light, and Westerham,
treading warily on the polished parquet
floor, made his way to a seat. He was feeling
fatigued and not a little miserable.</p>

<p>First he took the precaution of drawing a couple
of half-crowns from his pocket and slipping them
into the man's hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be alarmed at my appearance,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I am not a fugitive from justice. I am
merely an English gentleman who has lost his
friends and who is in search of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me if you have staying in this hotel a very
tall young English lady with dark hair and dark
eyes? It is possible that she is travelling <i>incognito</i>,
but if she has given her right name it will be the
Lady Kathleen Carfax.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man scratched his head and looked worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would help Monsieur if I could,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but I can only assure him that there is no English
lady staying in this hotel at all. Alas! the season
is very bad, and we have few English visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Lady Kathleen was not at the Hôtel de la
Cloche did not disconcert Westerham very much.
He had foreseen that she was hardly likely to stay
in the most prominent hotel in the town. He had
merely called there because he knew that if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
wishes to make one's path smooth in a foreign city
it is just as well first to win the confidence of some
hotel porter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is many years,&#8221; he said to the man, &#8220;since
I stayed here. In fact, I have practically no recollection
of Rouen except of this hotel and the cathedral.
I should therefore be very much obliged if
you could furnish me with a complete list of all
the hotels where English people are likely to be
found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why now,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;that is an exceedingly
simple affair.&#8221; And he rattled off a list of
hotels.</p>

<p>Westerham repeated them after him, but found
he could not remember so many. Therefore he
wrote them down.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that this is a complete
list?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite complete, I should say,&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;for Monsieur's purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a weary air Westerham rose from the
cane-backed chair on which he was seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have disturbed you,&#8221; he said to
the porter, &#8220;but I must go in search of this lady
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man spread out his hands with a deprecating
gesture. &#8220;It is still very dark,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
Monsieur will find the hotels closed. Moreover, I
do not wish to be rude to Monsieur, all the night
porters may not be so accommodating as myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to help Monsieur,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;Monsieur will pardon me, but possibly this may
be some romance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders again, but with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
an air of civility and respect that Westerham could
not quarrel with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, it is not my business to inquire.
For the time it is merely my end to serve Monsieur
well. Be seated for a little while I make
coffee and bring rolls and butter. It will fortify
Monsieur against the damp air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughing a little, Westerham sat down again,
and suffered the man to bustle about. The fellow
was deft indeed, and soon Westerham was glad
that he had listened to his counsel.</p>

<p>The dawn came up, and the porter turned the
lights out, and Westerham sat in the twilight of
the early morning smoking more or less contentedly
cigarettes of the Caporal brand.</p>

<p>Shortly after six the man, who had been busy
cleaning boots, returned and made a gesture towards
the sunlight, which was streaming into the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Monsieur is in haste,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will not
seek to detain him. By this time the other hotels
will be open. If Monsieur's mission is urgent he
should continue his search.&#8221;</p>

<p>His air was so friendly and so charming that
Westerham resorted to the only expression of appreciation
of which he could conceive. He gave
the man another five shillings, and pledged him to
silence. None the less, he had little faith that the
man would keep his tongue still. The Frenchman
must talk.</p>

<p>Thereafter Westerham went out into the fresh
morning air and began his search. In turn he
visited the Hôtel de la Poste, the Grand, the Europe,
and the rest of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>It cost him a pretty sum to purchase the confidence
of half-suspicious and still sleepy porters,
but by the time he had worked through the list of
hotels with which the man at the Hôtel de la Cloche
had provided him he had come to the conclusion
that Lady Kathleen was of a certainty not in one
of these hostelries.</p>

<p>Was she still in Rouen? The doubt troubled
Westerham greatly, but he reflected that she might
have elected to put up at a more humble hotel than
any of those at which he had called. So with the
assistance of a fairly friendly policeman he secured
a second and much longer list of minor
inns.</p>

<p>The search, too, was successful. In a small and
narrow street he discovered a small hotel which
went by the name of the République. Here his
question put to the plump Madame who opened the
door at once kindled interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there was most decidedly an English lady
staying there&#8212;a young English lady of most distinguished
appearance. She had arrived about noon
on the day before, and said she intended to stay
there for a couple of days, as she expected friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had the friends arrived?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not as yet. Perhaps Monsieur was the
friend for whom she waited?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham doubted that, and found the situation
a trifle awkward to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said to the fat Madame, he was not
the friend whom Mademoiselle had come to meet.
He was, however, an acquaintance, and would call
later in the day.</p>

<p>Contenting himself with this, he lifted his hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and strolled down the street, followed by the
shrewd eyes of the landlady.</p>

<p>He walked on until he felt sure he was no longer
observed; then he walked back again.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the street to the République,
a few doors up, he discovered a <i>café</i> of humble
aspect, provided with tables beneath an awning
at which the thirsty could sit and refresh themselves.</p>

<p>At one of these tables Westerham took a chair,
and at the risk of violent indigestion called for
more coffee. He sat and sipped the sweet and chicory-flavoured
liquid and turned about in his mind
the best means of discovering the reason of Lady
Kathleen's visit to Rouen.</p>

<p>He debated with himself whether it would not
be better to go boldly over to the hotel and make
his presence known; but he reflected that such a
course might be unwise, more especially as Kathleen
might still elect to remain silent on the mystery
which still so much perplexed him. Indeed,
his presence might result in her abandoning the
business which had called her so suddenly from
London.</p>

<p>As time went on he glanced up and down
the street, watching everyone's approach with interest.
Westerham half expected to see the face
of Melun. Instead, however, towards half-past
eight his attention was aroused by the appearance
of a man whose aspect was out of keeping with the
little street.</p>

<p>The stranger was above middle height, and bore
himself with a certain air of quiet dignity. He was
dressed in black, his clothes being well cut, though
of obviously foreign tailoring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the man's face, however, which riveted
Westerham's attention. It was very dark, and the
nose was somewhat flat. Yet it was a face of great
refinement and a distinction accentuated in a
strange way by a long, black, and well-trimmed
beard.</p>

<p>The man was not a Frenchman, nor, Westerham
decided, was he a German; certainly he was
not an Italian nor an Austrian. A subtle something
about the man's whole appearance, indeed,
brought Westerham to the conclusion that he was
a Russian.</p>

<p>Yet why he fixed his nationality this way he
could not tell, and then that intuition which was
Westerham's great aid in times of trouble told him
that this dignified and daintily-walking stranger was
in some manner connected with Lady Kathleen's
presence at the Hôtel de la République.</p>

<p>So certain of this did he become that he took
the precaution of drawing further back into the
<i>café</i>, where he could sit in the shadows and watch
the passage of the stranger without arousing any
interest himself.</p>

<p>Twice the black-bearded man walked up the
street, glancing sharply at the République, and
twice he walked back with the same meditative and
dilatory air. Then he turned the corner and disappeared.</p>

<p>The patron of the inn busied himself about the
<i>café</i>, and, seemingly curious about the visitor's long
sojourn, Westerham ordered a further supply of
the chicory-like coffee.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on so the sunshine became
stronger, till the cobbles in the little streets shone
hard and bright in the glare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>At ten Westerham's glance was attracted by
some bustle about the door of the inn, and he saw
the fat landlady bowing and scraping on the white
doorstep, and then out of the shadows into the sunshine
came the girl he had come to find.</p>

<p>Dressed all in black and thickly veiled, Lady
Kathleen came quickly out of the doorway and
walked down the street.</p>

<p>Westerham, who had taken the precaution to previously
settle his score, immediately rose and
walked after her.</p>

<p>The street was so narrow and there were so many
people about that he had to follow Kathleen pretty
closely in order to avoid losing her. He noted with
some surprise that she walked straight ahead, as
though of prearranged purpose, never faltering and
never so much as glancing to the right or to the
left.</p>

<p>He followed her down the hill, and so into the
space about the cathedral, where busy women were
setting out their wares&#8212;poultry, pottery, vegetables
and the like.</p>

<p>More than one head was turned to note the
quick, silent passage of Lady Kathleen. Hers, indeed,
was a physique which could not have escaped
notice, no matter what its surroundings.</p>

<p>On the market-square, having a clearer view before
him, Westerham slackened his pace and allowed
Lady Kathleen to increase the distance between
them.</p>

<p>Still she walked straight ahead, as one who follows
an oft-trodden path and knows full well
whither that path leads.</p>

<p>She moved up the cathedral steps, and as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
did so Westerham saw approaching the sombre figure
of the black-bearded man whose presence in the
little street by the Hôtel de la République had
aroused his interest earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>But though their steps were evidently leading
them to the same spot, neither the black-bearded
man nor Lady Kathleen made the least sign. The
girl passed into the cathedral, the man following
closely on her heels.</p>

<p>In fear of losing sight of them Westerham almost
ran across the square and darted up the cathedral
steps. But for all his speed his feet fell
silently, so that neither the girl nor the man, who
now walked by her side, heard his quick pursuit.</p>

<p>Once in the cathedral, Westerham paused to accustom
his eyes to the dimness of the light.</p>

<p>Far up the nave he could see the man and the
girl walking side by side.</p>

<p>Then they turned from the nave into the north
aisle and made their way thence into one of the
dark recesses of a side chapel.</p>

<p>As he watched them vanish into the shadows
Westerham paused.</p>

<p>He felt that he was spying, and the task was an
uncongenial one, but he comforted himself with
the reflection that, after all, he played the spy out
of a desire to serve Lady Kathleen, and he walked
on.</p>

<p>He saw that it would be impossible for him to
approach the side chapel by the same way as Lady
Kathleen had if he wished to remain unobserved.
So he turned aside and drew near to the chapel by
another way, sheltering himself behind the pillars,
which cast black shadows on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Westerham was following his old stalking habit,
which he had acquired when in pursuit of big game
among the giant pines of the Rockies. Yet with
all his care he almost blundered into his quarry.
For, as he moved silently round a pillar, he became
conscious that he was so near to Lady Kathleen
that he could have stretched out his hand and
touched her.</p>

<p>In an instant he drew back and stood still behind
a massive column. He could see nothing, but he
could hear the voices of the girl and her companion
in low and earnest conversation.</p>

<p>At first it was the man who did most of the talking,
and from what scraps of his words he could
catch Westerham judged him to be speaking in
French. He droned on for some minutes, and then
his voice died away.</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen now asked several questions in
quiet, low tones. The man answered sharply and
incisively, and it seemed to Westerham that there
was command in his voice.</p>

<p>For a while there was a complete silence, which
at last was broken by long, choking sobs. Edging
a little nearer round the pillar, Westerham saw
Kathleen kneeling upon a <i>prie-dieu</i> as though in an
abandonment of grief. She was crying as though
her heart would break, her face buried in her hands.</p>

<p>The sombre man stood by like some tall shadow,
silent and unmoving.</p>

<p>A quick and great desire to go to Kathleen's aid,
to gather her into his arms and comfort her, took
possession of Westerham. But great as his desire
was, he forced it down, recognising that the moment
had not come for him to intervene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the sombre man moved closer to Lady
Kathleen's side, and, putting out a gloved hand,
touched her lightly, and with the air of one offering
silent sympathy, on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Westerham heard him murmuring what must
have been words of comfort, and before long Kathleen
lifted her face and resolutely wiped away her
tears. Then she rose and went forward to the altar,
on the steps of which she knelt and prayed.</p>

<p>Finally she came back to the black-bearded man
and held out her hand, and Westerham saw with
still growing wonder that the man bent over it as
though with great respect and brushed Kathleen's
fingers with his lips. Without any further word
Kathleen walked quickly and quietly away, making
for the door through which she had entered the
cathedral. The man, with a little sigh, picked up
his hat and followed her, Westerham hard upon his
heels.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunshine, Westerham watched
Kathleen make across the square by the way which
she had come. Her companion turned abruptly to
the right and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>Westerham followed Kathleen back till she came
to the Hôtel de la République, when she disappeared
through the doorway.</p>

<p>Once again Westerham took his seat at a table
underneath the awning of the <i>café</i> that he might
watch developments.</p>

<p>And if on the night before he had been completely
unable to understand the reasons which had
taken Lady Kathleen to Rouen, he was infinitely
more out of his mental depths now. This sombrely-attired,
black-bearded man could not possibly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
any tool of Melun's. Melun did not employ gentlemen,
and that this man was one Westerham did
not doubt. For two hours he sat and watched the
doorway and the street; but no one either came or
went whom Westerham could even distantly connect
with Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>All the while he sat there he suffered great agony
of mind. It was torture to him to think that not a
score of yards away Kathleen sat alone and in great
distress, and that he was powerless to comfort her.</p>

<p>Yet was he powerless? He could at least make
one more attempt to help her. With this resolve
he crossed the road and asked to see the English
lady staying there.</p>

<p>He sent up no name, deeming it wiser not to do
so. He recognised that Kathleen was of that type
of woman who, if danger threatens, must know
the worst at once. She would be curious to discover
the identity of the stranger who sought an
audience with her, and would ask him to go up.</p>

<p>In this opinion he was justified, for the fat landlady
came down and said that the English
mademoiselle would be pleased to see him. He
went quietly up the stairs, and without so much as
knocking at the door walked into the little sitting-room
which Kathleen had engaged.</p>

<p>As she beheld him she started back with a quick
cry of terror. &#8220;Even here!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Must you follow me even here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham bowed his head. Now that he found
himself in her presence explanation became difficult.
For a few minutes he could say nothing but
stood watching Kathleen, who had sunk down into
a chair as if utterly worn out in body and in spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Westerham gathered himself together and came
to the conclusion that the time had now come when
he at any rate should no longer continue to make
mysteries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I owe you a deep
apology for following you here. I learnt of your
visit to Rouen quite by accident from my friend,
Lord Dunton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend, Lord Dunton!&#8221; exclaimed Kathleen
with wide-open eyes. &#8220;Your friend, Lord
Dunton! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Westerham, simply, &#8220;that Lord
Dunton is my friend. You know me as James
Robinson, a man who, in order to secure acquaintance
with yourself, had to indulge in the very
questionable privilege of a friendship with Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, believe me, quite by accident I discovered
that Melun in some way held your father in
his grasp. I was sorry for Lord Penshurst, but infinitely
more sorry for you. I offered you my help,
but you refused it. It was, perhaps, impertinent on
my part, and I cannot blame you for doubting the
genuineness of my offer. I was not then in a position
to explain either my motives or my identity.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;James Robinson&#8217; is not my name. I am, as
a matter of fact, the Sir Paul Westerham who was
reported to have disappeared from the <i>Gigantic</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen was staring at him in greater
astonishment than before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was my whim&#8212;possibly a foolish whim&#8212;to
vanish as I did. I cannot possibly regret it, because
I think it has really placed me in a position
to help you out of your difficulties. I want you
to treat me with that confidence which, I assure
you, I really deserve. I stand in no fear of Melun,
nor, indeed, of any man. Melun is simply in my
pay. I bought his services for my own ends, and
I can equally buy his services for yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and watched Lady Kathleen closely.
She appeared utterly unstrung, and clasped her
head tightly with both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly understand what it all means,&#8221;
she said at last in a dull voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It simply means this,&#8221; urged Westerham,
quietly, &#8220;that I am an honest man and a gentleman;
and if you could only tell me what it is of
which you and your father are so much afraid, I
feel perfectly certain that with the hold I have
over Melun I could free you from your trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen searched his face with her eyes eagerly
and yet fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I have
no reason to believe any man. I am sorry, but it
is impossible for me to believe you even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and then cried out again: &#8220;No, no!
it is quite impossible! Besides, surely if you have
been with Melun so much, and seen so much, you
must know what this dreadful thing is all about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;that
I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Kathleen answered: &#8220;I am sorry, but I
cannot believe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly her face was flooded with colour.
&#8220;You followed me here,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and saw the
man who spoke to me, and yet you still tell me that
you do not know! Do not know that while I can
save my father I am lost!</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you know,&#8221; she cried again hysterically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
&#8220;that in the cathedral I received my sentence of
death? For it means death to me! I cannot face
dishonour!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wild and uncontrolled as the girl's words were,
there was a convincing ring of truth in them, and
Westerham for the first time in his life knew what
fear meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who,&#8221; he asked with dry lips, &#8220;who in this
world could possibly have the power to order you
such a fate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know!&#8221; cried Kathleen, fiercely, her eyes
starting from their sockets in terror, &#8220;you must
know that it is by order of the Czar!&#8221;</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class="smaller">STRANGE HAPPENINGS</span></a></h2>


<p>&#8220;By order of the Czar!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham repeated the words, and his face was
blank in its amazement. Lady Kathleen caught his
expression and her own face changed. She saw
that Westerham's surprise was entirely genuine.
She saw that he did not know!</p>

<p>&#8220;By order of the Czar!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham repeated the words again, groping
for some explanation of this extraordinary statement.
He could find none. This, indeed, was the
greatest mystery of all.</p>

<p>When he had slightly collected himself he drew
a chair to the table and sat down heavily, facing
Lady Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that we had better
be plain with each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen's face was now a blank, as his
own had been two minutes ago.</p>

<p>Almost roughly she brushed away the tears from
her cheeks with the back of her hand, and set her
mouth and squared her shoulders as though about
to do battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand it,&#8221; she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> &#8220;I cannot
understand it at all. I had to distrust you, and so,
though you declared you knew nothing, I did not
believe you. But even if you know nothing it does
not help us in the least. I am not able to disclose
anything at all. It's my father's secret&#8212;not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gently and persuasively Westerham urged her
to tell him how the matter affected herself. But
she declined, and remained obdurate to the close of
the interview.</p>

<p>Before he ceased his pleading, however, Westerham
counselled her to tell her father all that had
passed, and begged her to urge Lord Penshurst to
send for him the moment she arrived back in London.</p>

<p>This Kathleen consented to do, although she
pointed out that her father would in all probability
decline to believe in Westerham's <i>bona fides</i>.</p>

<p>He countered that argument by asserting that
Lord Dunton would of a certainty establish his
identity beyond all doubt. But still Lady Kathleen
demurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it would be exceedingly
difficult to arrange a meeting. Frankly, I
don't see how you can help us, and there is only a
week left.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she said this her eyes again filled with tears,
and she clasped her hands with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;That there is only a week left,&#8221; persisted Westerham,
&#8220;is all the more reason why I should be
made acquainted with the facts at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen, however, only shook her head and
moaned a little to herself.</p>

<p>Westerham did his best to console her, and she
then told him that she proposed to return to London
by the afternoon's mail. Immediately on arriving
in town, however, she would have to set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
for Trant Hall, as the Premier was giving a dance
there on the following night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;that you will at
least permit me to see you safely home. It is not
at all advisable that you should travel without an
escort. I have every reason to be fearful on your
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen thanked him, but declined his offer of
help.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to prevent your
travelling in the same train or the same boat; and
if you think it advisable, I shall be grateful to you
for doing so. But I must implore you not to speak
to me or to make any sign that you know me between
here and London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matters have grown doubly bad since this
morning. I have not only to fear the spies of
Melun, but the agents of the Russian Government.
Between the two I am afraid I shall have but little
peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having said this, she rose and held out her hand
to bid Westerham good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can no longer refuse to believe in you,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;though I fear I shall have a harder task to
convince my father than you had to convince me.
Good-bye, and thank you. I really feel that you
would be a powerful ally, and if I can possibly persuade
him to take you into his confidence I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, of course, would be the better way,&#8221; said
Westerham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> &#8220;I assure you that I must have a
great deal of knowledge of Melun which would be
invaluable to your father. Still, if he declines to
tell me anything, remember that I am quite prepared
to serve him blindly and in all good faith. I
shall be quite content to wait for an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>On this he took his departure, and presently
made his way to the station, where he waited for
the afternoon mail. Long before the train was due
he saw Kathleen enter the railway station carrying
a black bag. He gave no sign, and she, for her
part, steadily ignored his presence.</p>

<p>At Dieppe he watched her go on board the mail-boat,
and then followed her to the saloon deck.
There he kept her under surveillance, but made no
attempt to communicate with her in any way.</p>

<p>Thus quietly watchful, he guarded her progress
to London, where, at Victoria, he saw her enter a
hansom and drive rapidly away. His thoughts had
been so busy with the things of the immediate present
that until he found himself alone at the London
terminus he took no thought of what he should
next do.</p>

<p>He then decided that he would go to his greatly-neglected
rooms in Bruton Street in order to obtain
some additions to his all-too-scanty wardrobe,
for, with the exception of a few things he had purchased
when he left Walter's Hotel, he practically
had nothing but the clothes he stood up in; and
these were the clothes with which he had been so
mysteriously furnished while he lay chloroformed
at Mme. Estelle's.</p>

<p>On arriving at Bruton Street the doorkeeper surveyed
him with astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir! I was told that you had gone
abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone abroad!&#8221; exclaimed Westerham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> &#8220;Gone
abroad! Nothing of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He denied the suggestion flatly, and, indeed, was
so taken aback by the man's manner that for the
moment he quite forgot he had in reality not only
been abroad but had returned again from abroad
in the space of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The man stared at him steadily, and for all his
self-possession, Westerham felt himself colour a
little. But he reflected that it was no business of
the man's whether he went abroad or not. He requested
him to take him up to his rooms in the
lift.</p>

<p>The man stared at him in greater astonishment
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are empty, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty!&#8221; cried Westerham. &#8220;What on earth
do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, sir,&#8221; said the man, in an excited voice,
&#8220;that your furniture has been taken away. I understood
that it was warehoused. A gentleman
called here this afternoon, paid your valet and dismissed
him, and this afternoon a pantechnicon came
and took away your things. The gentleman gave
his card to the manager of the flat and told him
that he was a solicitor. It all seemed fair and
square, and as we knew&#8212;begging your pardon, sir&#8212;that
you were an eccentric gentleman, we were
not surprised to hear that you were not coming
back. As a matter of fact, sir,&#8221; the man concluded
lamely, &#8220;we thought that you had been a little put
out by the affair here a few days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean to tell me,&#8221; said Westerham,
slowly, as though he could not believe his
ears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> &#8220;that everything has been taken away, even
my clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even your clothes, sir. Your valet packed
them himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; said Westerham, more to
himself than to the man, &#8220;and I have nothing but
what I stand up in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it struck him that he must take immediate
action in the matter. He suspected Melun was at
the bottom of this too, but could not conceive what
motive the captain could possibly have for this last
extraordinary move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any idea,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;where my
valet went?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor where my things have been stored?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the man shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a big pantechnicon, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
to the best of my knowledge there was no name on
it. I believe it did strike me as being rather funny
at the time, but I was busy and didn't take much
account of it. It is a most unaccountable thing, sir&#8212;most
unaccountable. I cannot understand it at
all. Have you any idea, sir, who your friend
might be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham shook his head, though in his own
mind he had little doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said briskly, &#8220;I must inform the
police at once. This is a very serious matter. It
is not so much the loss of the things that annoys
me, but the inconvenience to which I am put.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the man sharply, and endeavoured
to ascertain whether he could trust him. He decided
that the man looked honest, and slipped a half-sovereign
into his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the meantime,&#8221; he said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> &#8220;say nothing
to anyone. I will deal with this matter in my
own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deciding to take the bull by the horns at once,
Westerham hailed a passing hansom and drove to
Melun's rooms, only, however, to be informed that
the captain was out of town. He tried threats,
cajolery and even bribery to extort information
as to the captain's whereabouts; but the housekeeper
was proof against all his efforts.</p>

<p>It seemed as if she really did not know where
the captain was.</p>

<p>As he turned away, wondering in which direction
he could next inquire, it suddenly occurred to
him that he should ascertain if anything had happened
to his motor car. He therefore took a second
cab and drove to Rupert Street, in which the
garage was situated.</p>

<p>As he entered the yard the manager stepped forward;
and the astonishment on his face was even
greater than that exhibited by the doorkeeper at
Westerham's flat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, sir,&#8221; he said before Westerham
had time to speak, &#8220;that we have made some terrible
blunder. A gentleman called here this afternoon
and said that he had been asked to see me on
your behalf. He said that he had received a telegram
from Holyhead asking him to see that your
car was sent up to Chester, as you would be staying
there for some days. Your man was to wait
for you at the Blossoms Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham could scarcely disguise his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was this&#8212;gentleman like?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said the manager of the garage, eyeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
him anxiously, &#8220;I didn't take much account of
him, though he appeared a very pleasant gentleman
indeed. He was, I should say, tall and dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hook nose and black eyes?&#8221; suggested Westerham,
helpfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, sir, just so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham ground his teeth with rage. &#8220;Of
course,&#8221; he said to the man, &#8220;I do not blame you&#8212;I
cannot&#8212;but you've been hoaxed. I sent no
orders about my car. I intended it to remain here
until I sent for it. I may want it at any moment
now, and the inconvenience and the loss of it may be
great. You'd better wire to Chester for the man
to return at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager of the garage was by this time
greatly alarmed. His own suspicions led in the
direction of theft, and the prospect of a considerable
loss in reputation, if not a considerable loss in
pocket, scared him very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir, certainly. And if in the meantime
I can place any other car at your service I
shall be pleased to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll let you know,&#8221; said Westerham, and he
walked abruptly away.</p>

<p>He went rapidly westward and reached the park.
There he sat down in the darkness and made a further
effort to understand the drastic and impudent
measures which Melun was taking.</p>

<p>If he could have come across that person at that
particular moment there is little doubt but that he
would have shaken the life out of him. Westerham's
anger was seldom roused, but when it mastered
him it was terrible, and the effects were apt
to be disastrous to the object of his wrath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, turn things over in his mind as he might
he could see little chance of coming to any conclusion
until he could obtain the truth from Melun
himself. But where was Melun? It would be
ridiculous to make any further inquiries at his
house. Crow, too, would certainly know little, and
Bagley less.</p>

<p>True, there was Mme. Estelle. He would see
her.</p>

<p>Leaping to his feet, he almost ran to the cab-rank
at Hyde Park corner, and, hiring a taxicab,
ordered the man to make the best speed possible to
Laburnum Road.</p>

<p>The man did his best, and in some twenty minutes'
time the taxicab entered the little <i>cul-de-sac</i>,
the features of which Westerham was now beginning
to know too well.</p>

<p>He rang the bell impatiently, but the door in the
wall failed to open. He rang again and again, but
there was no response.</p>

<p>The driver of the taxicab surveyed his fare with
some distrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that your friends
are not at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's answer sounded very much like an
oath.</p>

<p>He gave one final pull to the bell, and finding
even that last rough summons ineffectual, turned
to the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> &#8220;this may seem a rather
curious business to you, but if you will help me I
will pay you well. I am not at all sure that this
house is as empty as it seems. Put your cab alongside
the wall so that I can climb over the top. I
want to go investigating.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man grumbled something to the effect that
it was not his business, but the sight of the magnificent
inducement which Westerham immediately
offered him silenced his objections.</p>

<p>Westerham climbed to the top of the cab and
dropped over the wall into the garden. He walked
round the house and found it shuttered, dark and
silent.</p>

<p>He whistled a long whistle to himself. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;if the birds have flown. I wonder
if they have chucked up the sponge. I
wonder&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>A second thought, however, which occurred to
him, as he proceeded to climb over the garden wall
again, was that it was much more likely that the
house had been closed that evening in order that he
might be cut off from all sources of information.</p>

<p>On further reflection, indeed, he came to the
conclusion that this was certainly the case. &#8220;But
perhaps you imagine,&#8221; he thought, mentally addressing
Melun, &#8220;perhaps you imagine that I shall
not come back. We will see.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then nearly eleven o'clock, and Westerham
had no course but to return to the Buckingham
Palace Hotel, out of which he had rushed
without bag or baggage on the night before.</p>

<p>There he was greeted civilly, but by no means
with effusion. Lord Dunton's visit on the previous
afternoon had set a certain cachet on his respectability,
but at the same time his erratic movements
did not meet with the managerial approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning he sought out Dunton,
who told him that for the moment Lord Cuckfield
and Mendip would be silent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Westerham's promise to Lady
Kathleen prevented his telling Dunton over much.
But fortunately Dunton, in spite of his apparent
vacuity, had both the good sense and the good
manners never to be over curious.</p>

<p>Twice during the afternoon Westerham took a
cab to Laburnum Road, and on the second occasion
his peal at the bell was answered by the maid he
had seen on his previous visit.</p>

<p>In reply to his queries the girl stated that Mme.
Estelle, having occasion to go out of town the day
before, had closed up the house because she did
not like to leave the maids by themselves. Madame
however, she told him, was expected back in the
course of the evening; she thought about nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>The sense of coming action prompted Westerham
to dine well. Unlike other men, his senses
and capacities were always at their best after
dinner.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he went back to Laburnum Road
and was told that Madame was at home. As he
entered the pretty drawing-room Mme. Estelle
came forward to greet him with outstretched hand.
But he kept his own behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;but before I meet
you on terms of friendship there are certain things
which I want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame raised her eyebrows at him and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what are they?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, who stole my furniture and
my belongings from my flat?&#8221; demanded Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you ask me?&#8221; answered Madame,
evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I have not the
slightest doubt in the world that Melun was the
man who ordered their removal, and if Melun is
responsible then you are probably acquainted with
the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Madame, quietly, &#8220;and I expect
that it will do no harm for me to confirm your
suspicions. Melun did order your things to be removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame smiled again. &#8220;It was at my suggestion.
It is impossible for me to give the reason;
but I must ask you to believe that such a step was
necessary for the greater security of your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham stared at her; the matter was entirely
beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the car,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;what of that?
Was it you also who suggested it should be sent
on a bogus mission to Holyhead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was. That step was also necessary in the
interests of your safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Utterly regardless of Madame's presence, Westerham
paced angrily up and down the room for
some minutes before he spoke again. Finally he
turned upon the woman and asked almost roughly
where Melun was to be found.</p>

<p>Madame shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you decline to tell me?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>Madame shrugged her shoulders again.</p>

<p>By this time Westerham had made up his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
as to how he should deal with this woman. There
had been ample time since he had left Lady Kathleen
to reason out what she meant by the words
that, as she preferred death to dishonour, her death-warrant
had been sealed. For some strange reason,
still to be unearthed, the Czar's emissary had ordered
that Kathleen must marry Melun and thereby
ensure silence.</p>

<p>How did Mme. Estelle stand in this matter?
Westerham determined to ascertain for himself
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said almost gently. &#8220;Let us for
a few moments try to talk as friends. It is imperative
that I should see Melun at once. You are
the only person who can tell me where I can find
him. And if you will come to a bargain with me
it may be to our mutual advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell you something which I think it is to
your interest to know, and if you think the knowledge,
when I have given it you, is worth it, will
you in return tell me where Melun is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see,&#8221; answered Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you acquainted with the fact,&#8221; he asked
suddenly, &#8220;that in a week's time Melun will have
arranged to marry the Lady Kathleen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame went pale to the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a lie!&#8221; she almost screamed. &#8220;It's a lie!
It's impossible! He has promised himself to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham nodded thoughtfully. It was precisely
as he had thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I tell you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe to be absolutely
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watching her closely, Westerham saw that Mme.
Estelle was greatly agitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; she murmured, more to herself
than to him, &#8220;to-night it could be proved, if only
I had a witness here whom I could trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; suggested Westerham, &#8220;though we
are on opposite sides in this struggle, you can take
my word on a matter of this sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; cried Mme. Estelle, eagerly, &#8220;you
are a gentleman. I can trust you. Oh, how I wish
I could trust Melun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice trailed away and she lapsed into
thought.</p>

<p>Presently she roused herself as though with an
effort and looked Westerham in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you how you can meet Melun if you
will give me your word of honour on two points.
First, that you will return and tell me all that
passes, and, secondly, that you will not, whatever
happens, do any harm to Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word,&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle sighed as though with relief, and
after a few seconds spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am going to tell you now,&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
&#8220;will sound so incredible that you may possibly
not believe me. I can scarcely believe it myself,
except that there is practically no piece of folly
which Melun will not commit when he has one of
his mad fits upon him. I sometimes think he is
half-crazy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night Lord Penshurst gives a ball at Trant
Hall. The place will be crowded, and the women
will be wearing jewels worth a king's ransom.</p>

<p>&#8220;More, I think, out of bravado, and with a foolish
notion of bringing matters to a head, Melun is
taking down half a score of masked men. It will
be what I think you call in America &#8216;a hold-up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melun says that there is no risk in the business,
that he and the others are bound to get away,
and even if he is caught he knows the Prime Minister
will have to contrive his release. The hour
planned for this business is midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation Westerham leapt
up from his chair and took out his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just an hour and a half to get there,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class="smaller">MELODRAMA AT TRANT HALL</span></a></h2>


<p>When Lady Kathleen bade good-bye to Westerham
she drove first to Downing Street, where she
met her father.</p>

<p>Together they travelled down to Trant Hall, and
on the way Kathleen gave Lord Penshurst a full
account of all that had passed since she had been
summoned so suddenly to Rouen.</p>

<p>The Premier sat with bowed head, holding his
daughter's hand as he listened to her narrative. For
the moment it seemed to crush him utterly, and
when Kathleen had finished speaking he lifted up
his head and said, in a stricken way:</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is the end of it?&#8221; He added, after a
few moments: &#8220;Are you sure that a week is the
full limit of time we can obtain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only too certain,&#8221; answered Kathleen.
&#8220;If we fail within the next week, then&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; she
broke off and looked apprehensively about her as
though even the cushions of the carriage might
have ears. Finally she bent her head and whispered
into her father's ear.</p>

<p>At this Lord Penshurst grew paler than before,
while great drops of sweat broke out on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> &#8220;must never be! Kathleen,
great though the sacrifice is, you must make it&#8212;make
it for our country's sake. Oh! to think that I
should have wished to serve her so well and should
have served her so evilly.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time after this Lord Penshurst and
his daughter sat in silence as the train ran on
through the night. It was not, indeed, until they
had reached Trant Hall and had a little supper, for
it was now very late, that Kathleen ventured again
to broach the subject of Westerham.</p>

<p>She was almost ghastly in her paleness, but was
entirely calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said, patting the old man's hand
as he sat staring before him as though fascinated
by some mental vision of pain and horror, &#8220;let us
try and see what we can do in this matter on a
business-like basis.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aged Premier nodded his head, but he still
gazed steadily before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think,&#8221; urged Kathleen, &#8220;that you
owe it to me to leave no stone unturned to defeat
Melun before the week is out? Melun we cannot
catch. You tried to do so, and Claude has tried to
do so during the last few days, but the man is as
elusive as an eel. Why not take this man Westerham
to a certain extent on trust? Of course, you
will laugh at me, and say that I am merely guided
by a feminine habit of jumping to conclusions.
Nevertheless, I am perfectly convinced that Mr.
James Robinson is Sir Paul Westerham, and that
if we were only to take him into our confidence he
could do much to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; said the old man, looking at his
daughter in a piteous way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> &#8220;it is, as you know,
simply impossible. We have neither of us been
released from our oath of silence, and it would be
most disgraceful of us to break our word. Indeed,
it would be absolutely indefensible, unless by breaking
it we were absolutely certain we could save the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not ask Sir Paul Westerham to help us
without telling him anything?&#8221; suggested Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think any man would be such a fool as
to serve us on those terms?&#8221; asked the Premier.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has promised to do so,&#8221; cried Kathleen.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst, however, remained obstinate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! my dear!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's quite out
of the question. It would arouse considerable comment
if we were to postpone this dance to-morrow&#8212;there
is no legitimate excuse for doing so. Let
us get it over and then we will together see what
can be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot even take Claude into our confidence,
but I can at least give him <i>carte blanche</i> to
take any steps that he deems necessary. And
Claude is not a fellow, thank goodness, to stick at
much if we have anything at stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, and coming over to his
daughter's side stroked her hair gently.</p>

<p>He did not tell Lady Kathleen so, but on one
point the old man had made up his mind. Outwardly
he was encouraging Lady Kathleen to brace
herself for the sacrifice which appeared inevitable,
but he had in reality resolved upon another course,
even though it meant for him suicide or the gallows.</p>

<p>All through the following day Kathleen moved
through the great house silently superintending the
arrangements for the ball.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the majority of the house-party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
arrived, and at dinner-time both Lord Penshurst
and Lady Kathleen had to throw off their
gloom as best they could and devote all their minds
and energies to the entertainment of their guests.</p>

<p>Two or three great singers had come down from
London, and there was music in the grand saloon.
It was then that young Hilden sought out Lady
Kathleen and drew her apart from the guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kathleen,&#8221; he said to his cousin, &#8220;I want to
have a very serious talk with you. During the past
three weeks your father has asked me to do a great
many extraordinary things, and I have not scrupled
to carry out any of his instructions, though they
have involved a considerable amount of law-breaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know what all this business is about.
I assure you I have not the slightest idea, nor have
I the least wish to pry into my uncle's secrets; but
at the same time, I am growing very uneasy. This
mystery, whatever it may be, is weighing on him
greatly. He has completely changed in the last
month; he is becoming an old and almost broken
man. I do not wish to alarm you, but I feel that I
ought to open your eyes to this in case it may have
escaped you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you,&#8221; said Kathleen, wearily,
&#8220;but I have noticed it myself, and am very much
distressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not be more explicit?&#8221; urged Hilden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
&#8220;Why not tell me what this matter is about?
Surely I could take some of the burden off your
shoulders. It is a most amazing thing&#8212;and I think,
with all due respect to your father&#8212;a very wrong
thing that a trouble of this sort&#8212;and I can see it
is a great trouble&#8212;should be foisted on to the
shoulders of a mere girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at him sadly and wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could tell you, Claude,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
unfortunately I am pledged to secrecy. I think it
is more likely that my father will speak to you
about the matter to-morrow, though I fear that he
will tell you nothing more than you know at
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may, however, ask you to do several more
strange things. You have offered to help us, and
so let me implore you to help us by doing everything
that you are asked, no matter what it may
involve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kathleen,&#8221; cried Hilden, taking her hands and
looking into her eyes, &#8220;you know very well that
there is nothing that I would not do for your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked him, and drawing away her hands
left him, weighed down with a terrible oppression.
Her own thoughts frightened her. She was conscious
of a dreadful desire for a man's death. She
prayed to be delivered from the sin of hoping that
she might escape disgrace at the cost of a man's
life.</p>

<p>The ball began at about half-past ten, and for an
hour before that motor-cars and carriages had been
rolling up the long sweep of drive, and the reception-rooms
had been filling with the power, the
wealth, and the beauty of the country.</p>

<p>By her father's side Kathleen stood at the head
of the grand staircase to receive the guests. And
one after the other, with misdirected kindness, they
murmured their regret to see Kathleen looking so
far from well. Her father glanced round impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
at every such expression, till from the pallor
born of the despair which was settling down upon
her heart Kathleen's face assumed a vivid flush,
due to agitation and annoyance; so that from looking
wan and ill her beauty became feverish and
radiant.</p>

<p>Hilden, hovering near, felt his heart aching.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock all the guests had arrived, and
the grand staircase and reception saloon were alike
deserted, while the ball-room was thronged with
dancers and those who watched the dancing.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst had long been famous as a host,
and Lady Kathleen, in spite of her youth, was already
numbered among the great hostesses of the
country.</p>

<p>The scene, indeed, was full of splendour, and, as
Melun's greedy mind had anticipated, the jewels
of the women must have been worth upwards of
half a million.</p>

<p>The slow, low music of a waltz was stealing
down from the gallery, where the musicians were
placed, when Lord Penshurst, who had just entered
from the grand staircase, was conscious of some
disturbance in the hall. For a moment he did not
inquire what the cause of the upset might be; and
it was, perhaps, just as well for him that he did not.</p>

<p>Up the drive had swept three great motor-cars,
which had drawn up in a curious formation before
the great entrance. Their concentrated head and
side lights faced the door, so that the servants who
stood about the hall were almost blinded by the
glare.</p>

<p>From the cars descended a score of men in evening
dress. But as they came into the more subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
light of the hall the keen eyes of the servants
stationed there were quick to see that, in spite of
their shirt-fronts and their opera-hats, these men
were not gentlemen.</p>

<p>The arrival of so many men at once took the
groom of the chambers aback, but he hurried forward
to meet the guests, thinking that possibly this
might be some surprise party.</p>

<p>His hospitable intention, however, met with a
rude check, for he had scarcely taken half a dozen
steps forward when he found himself looking
down the barrel of a revolver.</p>

<p>A pleasant, easy voice called on him to stop, and
the man stood stockstill, staring stupidly straight
in front of him, half-fearfully and half-fascinated
by the glint of the six-shooter.</p>

<p>The other men poured in quietly and quickly and
formed a semi-circle about the door.</p>

<p>Three of their number remained outside, covering
with their revolvers the two country constables
who had been on special duty for the purpose of
controlling the traffic.</p>

<p>All the men were masked, not only their foreheads,
but their faces right down to their chins
being hidden in black crape.</p>

<p>The man who led them stepped forward and
ordered the groom of the chambers back; and the
man and his fellow-servants retreated before the
advance of the strange intruders.</p>

<p>A couple of armed and masked men sufficed to
keep the handful of men-servants penned in the
corner. Two others were stationed on the stairs
to check any advances in that direction, while two
others kept the passages closed against all comers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>At the head of about twelve men the leader
walked swiftly towards the door of the ball-room,
where he met Lord Penshurst face to face. For
the Prime Minister, growing uneasy at the continued
movement in the hall, had come out himself
to see what might be on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back, Lord Penshurst,&#8221; said the leader, still
in a pleasant and easy voice; &#8220;get back or I will
not answer for your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister checked himself, but craned
his head forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;By heaven!&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;I believe
that is you, Melun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind who I may be, but keep your
tongue still. Unless you wish to be quieted,
kindly refrain from mentioning names in my presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now turn about, if you please, and get back to
the ball-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this sudden confrontation by danger the
Prime Minister's troubles were for the moment
forgotten, and he was again the strong, courageous
man that he had once been. He looked straight and
steadily at the veiled eyes of the intruder, and declined
to turn about. Instead, he retreated backwards
step by step.</p>

<p>The music in the ball-room had effectually
drowned any noise of the disturbance except to
those who stood nearer to the door.</p>

<p>Among these was Hilden. He had followed
hard upon the Prime Minister's footsteps, and had,
at a glance, taken in the position of affairs.</p>

<p>Nor did he hesitate for a moment. Breaking
into a run, he dashed across the hall towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
little alcove in which he knew were placed the telephone
and the police call.</p>

<p>As he approached the alcove, however, he was
brought to a standstill by a man with a revolver.</p>

<p>Melun noted his progress, and turned about and
cried, &#8220;Keep that gentleman away. If he moves
another yard&#8212;shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Hilden threw one contemptuous glance at
Melun and walked on. The man hesitated to fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire! you fool,&#8221; shouted Melun, but the man
still held his hand and hesitated so long that Hilden
had gripped the barrel of his revolver in his
left hand before the fellow quite realised what was
happening.</p>

<p>If the man had scruples, Melun had none. His
revolver spoke quickly, and Hilden, with a little
cough, fell forward on his face.</p>

<p>Turning from his butcher's work, Melun whipped
round to meet the terror-stricken eyes of Lady
Kathleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take your daughter away, Lord Penshurst?&#8221;
he said in a low voice. &#8220;It is not my
fault that she has been compelled to look on this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister grasped Kathleen by the
arm and drew her into the ball-room. Melun closed
in on him and the other men followed.</p>

<p>As they entered the room they spread themselves
out fanwise in an obviously prearranged
plan.</p>

<p>Coolly and deliberately Melun discharged his
revolver at the painted ceiling overhead, bringing
down a little cloud of plaster.</p>

<p>The orchestra stopped in the middle of a bar, the
dancers came to a halt, and all those guests who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
had been sitting round the ball-room leapt with
cries to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun's voice rung out clear and hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I have no
desire to create a disturbance. If you will listen
to me all will be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning for a second to Lord Penshurst, he said,
&#8220;Get back to the middle of the ball-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister had no other course but to
obey.</p>

<p>Melun next proceeded to deal with those guests
who were nearest to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of you,&#8221; he said in a tone of easy command,
&#8220;all of you get back beyond the chandelier.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the great cut-glass candelabra
which hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Here and there a woman gave a little scream,
but for the most part the people who had been so
rudely disturbed were very quiet.</p>

<p>Melun watched the retreat through his mask,
and when all the guests had crowded together at
the end of the room he gave them further orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the men step to the front!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked angrily and defiantly at Melun
and his companions, but they had no option in the
matter, for a dozen revolvers were pointed in their
direction with unwavering nozzles.</p>

<p>Sullenly, angrily, the men came forward, and
formed a long chain before the women, who clung
together in terror or sat huddled on chairs, holding
their faces in their hands. There was a pause, and
Lord Penshurst turned towards his guests.</p>

<div class="caption">&#8220;<i>On the floor at Melun's feet there slowly grew a glittering

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I greatly regret this
outrage. Any loss which you may suffer at the
hands of these thieves I will, of course, make good,
but let me implore you to do everything in your
power to prevent any bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent!&#8221; thundered Melun. &#8220;You were not
asked to speak. Lady Kathleen, will you be kind
enough to leave your father and join the other
ladies?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen faced him with flaming eyes.
&#8220;No!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;My place is by my father's
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her father's arm and stood the very picture
of defiance, looking scornfully at Melun and
his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Melun, quietly; &#8220;have your
own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we will proceed to business,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and I will ask you ladies and gentlemen to be
quick; my time is short, and if we are to leave free
of interference there is not much time to spare.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, addressing the men,
&#8220;collect all the jewellery that the ladies hand you,
pass it on, and throw it here.&#8221; He pointed to the
floor at his feet.</p>

<p>The men hesitated, looking one to another; and
one boy, more bold than the rest, jumped forward
and cried, &#8220;Never! you dirty scoundrel!&#8221; And
he dashed across the floor towards Melun.</p>

<p>Melun let him come on, and it said something for
the coolness of the man that he did not even fire,
but waited till the lad was upon him. Then he
swung round, and catching him on the back of the
ear with the butt of his pistol, sent him sprawling
senseless to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>After that there was no demonstration of any
kind. With almost feverish haste the women began
plucking the jewels from their hair and from
their bosoms, from their wrists and from their
necks. Trembling, they handed them to the men
standing in a row before them.</p>

<p>One by one bracelets and necklets and tiaras were
tossed on to the floor at Melun's feet until there
slowly grew a glittering pile of jewels.</p>

<p>And then it became obvious that Melun had provided
against every contingency and had counted
on complete success.</p>

<p>For at a word from him one of the masked men
came forward with a rough sack, into which he
threw the jewels with as much care as he might
have bestowed upon a heap of coals.</p>

<p>When the fellow had gathered them all up Melun
made a little bow of mockery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have to
thank you for your hospitality and for your generosity.
With your kind permission I will now withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly a bold, clear, full voice spoke from the
little gallery in which the musicians sat cowering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,&#8221; said the voice, &#8220;I fear that
you have not my permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the guests started and turned involuntarily
to see whence came the challenge. Melun looked
up quickly and stood staring with amazement.</p>

<p>For stepping down the staircase which led from
the little gallery came Westerham, smiling serenely.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class="smaller">AT THE EMPIRE</span></a></h2>


<p>The better to show his contempt for the people
whom he was robbing, Melun had put away his
revolver. This little piece of play-acting cost him
dear.</p>

<p>As he saw Westerham coming down the stairs
his hand went to his hip-pocket. But Westerham
was first, and covered him in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up your hands!&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>Melun obediently threw up his hands.</p>

<p>The other masked men now covered Westerham,
but Melun cried out sharply: &#8220;Stop that! No
firing!&#8221;</p>

<p>For he knew who was the best shot, and who was
likely to be quickest; and he had no desire to risk
his own skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the men to lower their hands,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;and you can put your own hands down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun gave the order in a surly voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Westerham.</p>

<p>All this had passed in complete silence on the
part of Lord Penshurst's guests. Lord Penshurst
also was far too astonished to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive my intrusion,&#8221; Westerham
said, now addressing the Prime Minister, &#8220;but I
must ask you to allow me to have a word with this
man.&#8221; He pointed to Melun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Without more ado he came down the staircase
from the musicians' gallery and walked over to
Melun's side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an impudent scoundrel, Captain
Melun,&#8221; he whispered in the captain's ear, &#8220;but I
will put a stop to this. You will have to call your
men off and restore all that property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do nothing of the kind!&#8221; snarled Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won't, eh?&#8221; said Westerham. &#8220;Well, we
will see.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he added, still whispering, &#8220;that
Lord Penshurst is perfectly acquainted with your
identity. The guests are in ignorance, and therein
lies your safety. But how many would recognise
you if they could see your face?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun shot a vindictive look through his mask
at Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; continued Westerham, quietly, &#8220;I
will give you five seconds to make up your mind.
You either order all these jewels to be restored to
their proper owners or I will tear the mask from
your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven's sake don't do that,&#8221; cried Melun
in a low voice. &#8220;But it will cost you your life, for
I shall not be able to hold the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not bother you to do so,&#8221; said Westerham;
&#8220;I can manage them quite well myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still keeping Captain Melun under observation,
he turned about, while his revolver covered the
man who had collected the jewels. &#8220;Come here!&#8221;
he ordered.</p>

<p>The man came forward.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man handed over his six-shooter without a
word, and Westerham placed it carefully on the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now right-about!&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and get the
other men's weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruffian in the mask hesitated. &#8220;They will
shoot me and you, governor,&#8221; he said thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better be shot at by them than by me,&#8221;
said Westerham. &#8220;My aim rarely fails. Do as
you're told.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham then turned to the other men. &#8220;All
of you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will have to give up your guns.
If necessary, Captain Melun and I will see that you
do it. However, I should recommend you to be
quick. I warned Scotland Yard before I left London
of what was about to happen here, and within
a few minutes this place will be swarming with
police.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men fidgeted uneasily and looked helplessly
at Melun.</p>

<p>Melun wisely decided to assist Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you'd better be quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this there was a good deal of grumbling, and
one of the men cried out that they had been betrayed.</p>

<p>Westerham turned on him sharply. &#8220;I am compounding
a felony,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;but still, if you are
quick, you will get away. I won't detain you.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time two or three men had come in from
the hall to inquire the meaning of the delay. They
surveyed the scene uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of you are there?&#8221; demanded Westerham,
glancing towards the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> &#8220;I suppose it
is a case of twenty to one; but never mind. On
this occasion it is my move. Bring your guns over
here one by one. You on the left there start
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst and Kathleen were staring in
amazement at Westerham, as indeed were all the
guests. It was a simple exhibition of the domination
of one will over many. One by one the men
came forward and deposited their weapons at Westerham's
feet.</p>

<p>When they had all laid down their arms he turned
again to Melun. &#8220;You can call your men off
now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Melun was in no mind to remain. Without a
word he walked out of the ball-room, calling on the
men to accompany him; they followed him like
sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute, Lord Penshurst,&#8221; said Westerham,
easily, &#8220;while I see these visitors off the
premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out into the hall and watched the departure
of the three cars.</p>

<p>Melun was shaking with rage. So angry was he,
indeed, that his passion overcame his fear, and as
he was about to enter his car he stepped back into
the hall again and addressed Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall pay for this, my gentleman,&#8221; he said
in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>Westerham made no answer except to say,
&#8220;You're wasting time, and if you take my advice
you will not return to town along the same route
by which you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel and went back into
the ball-room. There the men were busy sorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
out the jewels on the floor and restoring them to
their proper owners.</p>

<p>As Westerham came in there was a simultaneous
movement towards him. A half-score of hands
were outstretched and a hundred voices clamoured
admiration and congratulation.</p>

<p>But Westerham held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be kind enough not to approach any nearer,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;my business is with Lord Penshurst. If
I have been of any service to you I am glad; but
please let the matter rest at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham walked over to Lord Penshurst and
looked reassuringly into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall be grateful
if you can spare me a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the Prime Minister; &#8220;let us
go to my own room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier led the way across the hall and
down a long corridor until he came to the library.
He bowed Westerham in before him and afterwards
closed the door.</p>

<p>There was open admiration in the Premier's eyes,
but at the same time he was distressed and ill at
ease. Like the diplomat he was, he waited for
Westerham to speak the first word. Westerham
spoke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the time has come for
mutual explanations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you,&#8221; answered Lord Penshurst,
&#8220;for having rid me of these ruffians to-night,
but as I imagine that you have only done so to suit
your own private ends,&#8221; he added coldly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> &#8220;I think
that it is you, rather than myself, who should
make the explanations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically all the explanations that I can
make,&#8221; said Westerham, &#8220;I have already given to
Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a very pretty tale, too,&#8221; remarked the
Premier, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;None the less a true tale. I can furnish ample
proof that I am the Sir Paul Westerham who disappeared
at Liverpool. I knew Lord Dunton before
I left England ten years ago, and he has twice
visited me in the States. I should hardly imagine
you would doubt his word, and he can certainly
establish my identity. If that does not satisfy you,
you can apply to my solicitor, Mr. Hantell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the Premier looked thoroughly unconvinced,
but in spite of this Westerham plunged once more
into the details of his meeting with Melun and the
bargain he had made with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see from all that I have told you,&#8221;
he concluded, &#8220;how good a grip I have on that
scoundrel. But for the influence that I can bring
to bear on him he would never have surrendered so
quietly to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course this escapade of his, mad though it
seems, was not without a motive, and I judge that
motive to be the further terrorising of Lady Kathleen
and yourself. Once more let me appeal to you
to tell me frankly and fully what it is that so distresses
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier almost laughed. &#8220;You must think
me a very credulous person indeed,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> &#8220;if
you expect me to believe such a tale as yours. I
have several reasons for thinking that you are no
better than Melun, I am not sure that you are not
worse. If, for some reason, you have served Lady
Kathleen and myself, I presume it is merely a
question of thieves quarrelling among themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham flushed hotly. But the Prime Minister,
though he noticed Westerham's annoyance,
continued to speak quietly and coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I go in search of Lord Dunton?
If you are not a liar, send Lord Dunton to me.
Not that it would help matters, for if you were
fifty times Sir Paul Westerham you could not assist
me, nor, indeed, would I ask your assistance. But
as I fully expect that you know as much about my
troubles as I do myself, it would in any case be
waste of breath to mention them; and certainly I
am not going to mention anything that will give
you and Melun a stronger hold of me than you
have already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you,&#8221; cried Westerham, &#8220;that I have
nothing to do with Melun's schemes. Nothing at
all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, of course,&#8221; said Lord Penshurst, drily,
&#8220;will presently be proved by your friend Lord
Dunton. In the meantime I warn you and your
accomplice Melun that you are rapidly driving me
to desperation. I admit that. I tell it to you to
impress on you the necessity of not going too far.
It is rather unfortunate that the Prime Minister of
England should have to liken himself to a worm,
but nevertheless I may mention that even a worm
will turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was exasperating, and Westerham found it
hard to keep cool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said with a sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> &#8220;I am sorry
you think so badly of me, and I will do my best to
open your eyes as to the real truth of matters. As,
however, I cannot do that to-night, I will ask you
to allow me to withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no objection,&#8221; said the Premier, &#8220;but
before you go perhaps I may offer you some hospitality.
I do not wish to be so ungrateful and ungracious
as to deny that I owe you some thanks
for to-night's work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged,&#8221; answered Westerham,
&#8220;but I would rather be excused the humiliation of
having to accept hospitality from the hands of a
man who does me so much injustice. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed out of the room, and the Premier let
him go without a word.</p>

<p>In the hall the hosts of departing guests eyed
him with curiosity and some anxiety.</p>

<p>Lady Kathleen was standing at the foot of the
staircase, and, to their surprise, she stepped forward
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>Westerham bowed over it but said nothing. He
would indeed have choked over any words which
he might have sought to utter. He was, perhaps,
in as trying a position as he could well be in.</p>

<p>It might have been that Lady Kathleen expected
him to say something, for she gazed after his retreating
figure a little sadly and wistfully. The
guests in their evening wraps drew aside to let this
tall man in a blue serge suit pass them.</p>

<p>A few of them held out their hands, and some
of them called &#8220;Good-night&#8221;; but Westerham
passed on unheeding.</p>

<p>The taxicab in which he had come down from
town was waiting at the door, and stepping into it
he ordered the man to return to London. It was
nearly three o'clock when he reached his hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>There, to his extreme annoyance, he was informed
by the porter, who now regarded him with
open suspicion, that a gentleman was waiting to
see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221; demanded Westerham,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn't give any, sir,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;but he
is in the smoking-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham entered that vast and dimly-lighted
apartment, to be greeted on the threshold by Inspector
Rookley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens! sir,&#8221; cried Westerham; &#8220;am I
never to be rid of this constant persecution?</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you received fairly explicit
instructions through the Commissioner from
Lord Penshurst to let me alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, sir,&#8221; said the detective, soothingly,
&#8220;but you have an unfortunate habit of stirring us
up afresh. I have called now about this business
at Trant Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Westerham, starting, &#8220;what about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Rookley, &#8220;that you were
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it's any satisfaction for you to know it,&#8221;
said Westerham, &#8220;I was. But I don't quite remember
seeing any members of the police force
there, and I should be glad to ascertain how it is
that my presence at the Hall was notified to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came first of all by telephone from the local
police,&#8221; said Rookley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> &#8220;and I then had a message
'phoned through from Lord Penshurst. It seems
that he sent word on your behalf, and he was at
great pains to tell us of the service you had rendered
him. He said he was telephoning because we might
imagine that you were in mischief, whereas you
happened to be the man who had saved them all
from theft and possibly from violence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, sir,&#8221; the detective continued, &#8220;that
clears you more or less. I cannot argue with the
Prime Minister, or I would have pointed out to him
that you must have been in the business yourself or
you could never have got wind of the affair and
turned up at all. So, as this is a very serious
matter indeed, I waited here to ask you what you
know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; cried Westerham, annoyed past all
endurance, &#8220;I don't know half as much about this
matter as Lord Penshurst does himself. If you
want to know what I had to do with it, go and ask
the Prime Minister. Personally, I decline to say
anything at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; Rookley was staring at him uneasily
while he scratched his head. He was as certain
as he could be in his official mind that he was
constantly running up against the most astute of
master criminals that he had ever met. It perplexed
him, too, beyond measure that, whenever he
felt his grip fastening on the man, the Prime Minister
should step in to save him.</p>

<p>He would truly have loved to arrest Westerham
there and then upon suspicion; but the telephonic
message from Trant Hall made that desirable object
impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said Westerham; and turning on
his heel he walked contemptuously away, leaving
the baffled detective to make what excuses he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to the night porter, who, ignorant of the detective's
identity, was beginning to suspect him of being
no more honest than he should be.</p>

<p>Westerham slept badly, and awoke, after a succession
of uneasy dreams, at about nine o'clock in
response to a knock at his door.</p>

<p>To his surprise it was neither the boots nor the
chambermaid who entered at his bidding; instead
there stood before him a tall, cadaverous man,
wearing a long black frock-coat, whom he instantly
recognised as the manager.</p>

<p>The manager closed the door and walked over
to Westerham's bedside. His manner was at once
offensive and deferential.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to excuse me, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
I thought it better to speak to you in your own
room than to rouse any remark by sending a message
requesting you to speak to me in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am aware that Lord Dunton called to visit
you here, and I know sufficient about his lordship
to feel no uneasiness about his friends as a rule.
But really&#8212;you must pardon my saying so&#8212;you
make things a little awkward in this hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham sat up in bed and looked at the man
quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your appearances and disappearances,&#8221; continued
the manager, avoiding Westerham's eyes,
&#8220;have already led to considerable comment. Besides,
after inquiry this morning, I discovered that
Mr. Rookley from Scotland Yard was here waiting
for you till the small hours. Fortunately the night
porter did not know who he was, or things would
have been still more awkward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand,&#8221; suggested Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> &#8220;it
might have been that Rookley called on me for the
purpose of consulting me rather than of holding
an investigation as to my movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager eyed him coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's hardly what I have been given to understand,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Westerham reddened with anger. It seemed to
him that Rookley, being baffled, was seeking to
make himself disagreeable. Westerham was beginning
to feel indeed something like an outcast,
moved on from place to place without time for rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to leave?&#8221; he asked shortly.</p>

<p>The manager made a queer sort of bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Westerham returned; &#8220;for my
part I have no objection.&#8221;</p>

<p>To himself he reflected that within a few days
the man would bitterly regret his mistake.</p>

<p>So Westerham packed his little bag and went
out. First he went on foot to Victoria, where he
left his bag in charge of the cloak-room.</p>

<p>Then he breakfasted at a restaurant, and after he
had consumed a moderate quantity of doubtful ham
and still more doubtful eggs he smoked cigarette
after cigarette while he thought over the situation.</p>

<p>At last he hit upon a solution&#8212;as he thought&#8212;to
the whole difficulty; a solution which was so
extraordinarily daring that he laughed to himself
as he conceived it.</p>

<p>The idea tickled his fancy immensely, but he did
not embrace it without all his customary caution.</p>

<p>Carefully and methodically he weighed the pros
and cons of success, only to be ultimately convinced
that the arguments against the scheme were
of practically no account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>To secure the success of his enterprise, however,
he needed at least one assistant, and his mind turned
without hesitation in the direction of Dunton.</p>

<p>But before he saw Dunton it was expedient to
ascertain the whereabouts of Melun. Then it occurred
to him that he had been more than foolish
to allow Melun to escape from Trant without having
secured any information as to where he now
lay in hiding.</p>

<p>Had he returned to his rooms? That was doubtful;
and the doubt was confirmed when Westerham
called at Rider Street to ascertain. Captain Melun
had not returned to town.</p>

<p>Grateful to Mme. Estelle for the timely news
she had given him of Melun's journey to Trant
Hall, Westerham was by no means unmindful of
his promise to tell her of all that had happened.</p>

<p>He had simply delayed his visit because he had
been in hopes that if he could only find Melun he
would be able to go to her with some definite proposition.</p>

<p>For it was now entirely obvious that Melun,
unable to be true to any man or any woman, had
merely been using Mme. Estelle as an agent, and
had not the faintest notion of fulfilling his promise
to her.</p>

<p>It was inconceivable that unless Melun wished
to push his advantage to the utmost&#8212;that is to say,
to the extreme limit of forcing Lord Penshurst to
agree to his marriage with Lady Kathleen&#8212;that
he could possibly have had the hardihood, not to
say the foolhardiness, of conducting the raid of
the night before.</p>

<p>Two days previously Lady Kathleen had declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to Westerham that only a week remained.
Two days of that week had already slipped away,
so that now only five days were left in which to
find Melun and bring his works to naught.</p>

<p>Westerham wondered whether he would find
Mme. Estelle tractable. That also was open to
doubt. And while he thought on the matter he
was tempted to go just a little back on his word
and refuse her the information she had asked for
until she told him in what way he could lay his
hands on the truant captain.</p>

<p>But this, he reflected, in spite of all that was at
stake, would be, to say the least of it, dishonourable;
and it was with every intention of proving to
Madame that the captain was playing her false that
Westerham took a cab and drove to St. John's
Wood. He found Mme. Estelle alone and anxious.</p>

<p>She gave him no greeting, though she almost
ran towards him as he entered the little drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you to tell me?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered Westerham, &#8220;that is absolutely
definite; but at the same time I am convinced
that Melun is not treating you justly and
honourably. After last night's affair was over&#8212;you
may not have heard that I defeated Melun's
raid&#8212;I spoke for some time with Lord Penshurst.
He would tell me nothing; but, none the less, I am
convinced that Melun is insisting that his marriage
with Lady Kathleen shall take place at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some minutes Madame sat in complete silence,
with her hands tightly clasped together.
Then she looked up and said, &#8220;Can you prevent
that without completely ruining Melun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Westerham, thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> &#8220;I think
I can contrive it; but I must first know where I
can see the captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame rose and looked at him long and earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though I trust your word,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can
see that it would be very difficult for you to meet
him without some dreadful trouble arising. If you
can only see him in public it would not matter so
much. You are a gentleman and would not create
a scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went on, more to herself than to
Westerham, &#8220;I think that is the better way. To-night&#8212;just,
I think, to prove that he cares for
nobody&#8212;Melun has taken a box at the Empire. I
am going there with him. It is possible that you
could join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham laughed with some bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am obliged to you for your suggestion,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but you do not seem to appreciate that I
have been robbed by Melun of all the appurtenances
of a decent existence. It is to his efforts&#8212;and to
some extent yours&#8212;that I am at the present moment,
in spite of all my millions, homeless. I have
not even a dress-suit to my name. If, therefore,
my appearance in your box this evening is a little
incongruous, you will have to excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so; quite so,&#8221; said Mme. Estelle with a
queer smile, the meaning of which was not at the
moment obvious to Westerham.</p>

<p>After this he took his departure; nor did he for
the moment fulfill his intention of visiting Dunton.
It was useless to go to that young man until after
he had met Melun. After that meeting his plans
might have to be remodelled.</p>

<p>To distract his thoughts he went to a matinee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and afterwards dined alone, lingering over his
cigarette till the restaurant clock showed him it was
half-past nine.</p>

<p>He then made his way to the Empire and entered
the lounge. From there he was able to discern
quite easily the box in which Melun was seated.
He made his way to it, and without even the formality
of knocking turned the handle of the door
and went in.</p>

<p>As he did so Melun rose angrily to his feet, and,
as though he had never known Westerham in his
life before, demanded what he meant by the intrusion.</p>

<p>Westerham bowed to Mme. Estelle, and then
turned his attention to the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't be a fool,&#8221; he said shortly; &#8220;I have not
the slightest intention of being treated in this way.
I think you had better sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>For his own part, Westerham drew up a chair
and seated himself in front of the box so that his
face and figure could be seen by all observers. It
was indeed the prospect of this which had so
alarmed Melun and had resulted in his taking up so
tactless an attitude towards Westerham. Melun
was fearful lest some of those present in the theatre
should have been numbered among Lord Penshurst's
guests of the night before, in which case
the freedom which Westerham made of his box
might lead to a suspicion that the captain himself
was implicated in the raid.</p>

<p>Westerham smiled at the discomfited Melun as
though he hugely enjoyed the joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well be alarmed,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> &#8220;and you
had better be civil, or I certainly shall not relieve
you of my presence, which is apparently obnoxious,
and which I fancy you imagine to be a source of
danger to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark you, Melun,&#8221; he went on, turning his
head away from Mme. Estelle so that the woman
could not catch his words. &#8220;Mark you, there are a
great many things about which I want an explanation.
When I made my bargain with you I had no
idea that I should come to be regarded as a partner
in crime with a murderer. Things have gone too
far.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, for Mme. Estelle's sake, I will not
cross-examine you here. I insist, however, that
you shall tell me where and when I can find
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I decline to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham had foreseen the possibility of this
answer, and had made up his mind as to how he
should meet it if it came. He saw that he could
not extort a statement from Melun there, and was
resolved on a different method.</p>

<p>Without a word&#8212;and he knew that his silence
would cause Melun the deepest anxiety&#8212;he rose
and left the box.</p>

<p>He waited patiently till the end of the performance
and then succeeded in following Melun into
the street.</p>

<p>As he had counted on his doing, Melun took a
hansom and drove away with Mme. Estelle. Westerham
followed.</p>

<p>The hansom in front of him bowled quickly along
Piccadilly, turned up Berkeley Street, and then
made at a good pace for Davies Street. Here Melun
alighted, and having said &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; to Mme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Estelle, let himself into a small private hotel with
a latch-key.</p>

<p>Westerham, who had passed Melun's cab,
stopped his own further up the street and marked
the house from the little window at the back of
the hansom. He was satisfied.</p>

<p>He immediately ordered the man to turn about
and drive to Dunton's room. Dunton was sitting
before a fire, enjoying a pipe before he turned in.</p>

<p>Westerham immediately plunged into every detail
of his story which he dared disclose and still
keep faith with Lady Kathleen. Dunton heard him
out with open-mouthed wonder.</p>

<p>Next Westerham proceeded to explain to Dunton
the counter-move against Melun which he intended
to put into execution on the morrow.</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking, Dunton rocked
on his chair with laughter, as though delighted beyond
measure with the proposal.</p>

<p>And certainly Dunton had some justification for
his merriment, for what Westerham proposed,
gravely and of fixed purpose, was the kidnapping
of the Prime Minister.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class="smaller">THE CAPTURE OF LADY KATHLEEN</span></a></h2>


<p>It was for very excellent reasons that Melun had
not driven up to St. John's Wood to fetch Mme.
Estelle to the Empire; and his caution in other
matters thus saved him from an unpleasant cross-examination
concerning Kathleen.</p>

<p>It is true that when Westerham had left the
box Madame made several efforts to broach the
subject, but Melun succeeded in steering clear of
the matter until after they had left the theatre.
As, however, the cab proceeded to Davies Street
she made a further attempt to pin him down to
the subject. But again Melun evaded it.</p>

<p>Few men knew better than Melun the damage
that could be done one by a jealous woman, and as
he sat alone that night over his whisky-and-soda,
the obvious signs of jealousy which Marie had
shown him caused him great disquiet.</p>

<p>From Madame, however, he turned to the more
important business of deciding what he should do
to bring the Premier to his knees without further
delay. And it was a strange coincidence that just
as Westerham was explaining to Lord Dunton his
scheme for kidnapping the Prime Minister, Melun
hit upon the plan of abducting Lady Kathleen as
the surest means of inducing Lord Penshurst to
surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>So each man in different parts of London worked
out two similar schemes, which on the morrow
were to clash and to produce an extraordinary
sequence of events.</p>

<p>Melun sat till late perfecting his plan of abducting
Lady Kathleen, but, turn and twist the matter
though he might, he saw no means of carrying it
through unless he sought Mme. Estelle's assistance.</p>

<p>Therefore he rose early in the morning, and was
ringing at the bell of the villa in St. John's Wood
before the neighbouring clocks were striking nine.
He knew that the most favourable opportunity for
his project would come shortly after noon, and
even though Mme. Estelle consented to lend her
aid there was still much to be done.</p>

<p>He entered the morning-room without ceremony,
and, scarcely pausing to say &#8220;Good-morning,&#8221;
drew a chair to the table at which Madame sat at
breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the crisis in our fortunes
has arrived to-day. I want all the help you can
give me, and you will want all your nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle eyed him calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But even though the crisis
in our fortunes arrived within the next ten minutes
there are certain questions which I must ask
you first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun fidgeted impatiently. He realised that he
could no longer baulk the question of Lady Kathleen,
and the sooner he got himself out of the difficulty
the better for his day's work.</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; said Madame, stretching out her
right hand and brushing Melun's lightly with her
fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> &#8220;George, are you playing me false?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Playing you false?&#8221; he cried, with a fine show
of indignation. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that either you have told me too much
or too little. If I am to believe you, the Premier's
secret which we hold is worth at least half a million
of pounds. You say you are certain of the
money, and that the moment it is yours we are to
be married and leave this miserable mode of life.
If this is so I am content. But now I hear other
news. I hear that this is not the only price which
you are asking for the return of the Premier's papers.
I am told that as part of the bargain you are
to be permitted to marry Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun jumped out of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a lie!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;and I'll take my oath
that that rattle-brained fool Westerham is responsible
for your stupid fancies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are they fancies?&#8221; urged Madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancies! Of course they are fancies. What
good do you think it would do me to be tied to a
girl like that? Surely half a million should content
any man. I wish to be free to pursue my life
with you. The sooner indeed I am free from all
this business the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bagley and the rest of them can say what they
please and shout as they please. They know nothing
that can possibly betray me, and certainly nothing
that can harm me. When he has paid the
price you may be sure that Lord Penshurst will
look to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Estelle looked greatly troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure, George,&#8221; she asked again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> &#8220;that
this is absolutely true? Oh! be sure that I dislike
to distress you in this way, but I cannot help
it. Up to the present I have found Sir Paul
Westerham a most truthful man, and I don't
see why he should be telling me falsehoods
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't see why?&#8221; echoed Melun, with
splendidly simulated scorn; &#8220;you don't see why?
Of course you don't, because you are blind! Blind!
You are blind with suspicion and distrust, and he,
for his own ends, is simply playing on your fears.
He wants to upset you, to put me out of court with
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he can break our friendship, if he can sever
the ties which bind us, then his task is the easier.
Has it not occurred to you that he has been trying
to turn your mind against me simply that he may,
for his own ends, call you to his aid? Is it not
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>For several minutes Mme. Estelle pulled her roll
to pieces and made little pellets of the dough with
her nervous fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said at last; &#8220;perhaps that is so. I
have not looked at it in that light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Marie,&#8221; cried Melun, with a greater
show of tenderness than he had yet exhibited,
&#8220;surely I have been true enough and faithful
enough all these years for you to believe me now.
Indeed, you must believe in me, because if you
don't believe in me and give me your support the
cup of happiness which is so near our lips may be
dashed away from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> &#8220;and see whether I am
speaking the truth or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for this business to drag on in
this way any longer. I must bring matters to a
head at once, and I see only one way to do it&#8212;I
shall kidnap Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle started and looked at him, half in
terror, half in admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bold plan,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bold plan,&#8221; Melun agreed, &#8220;and a plan
which must succeed if you will help me. The difficulty
is to get the girl away, and I shall have to
leave that entirely to you. What is more, there is
very little time to be lost. The Cabinet meets at
noon, and for a couple of hours after that Lord
Penshurst will be busy with his colleagues. Consequently
during that time Lady Kathleen will be
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately I managed to put young Hilden
out of the way, at least for a time, so that we shall
be free of his prying and peeping and officiousness
when you call to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I call to-day!&#8221; repeated Madame in
tones of wonderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; continued Melun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> &#8220;it is you who
will have to call. As things are at present it is
naturally impossible for me to show my face near
Downing Street. With you, however, the matter is
quite different. No one there knows you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I have left nothing to chance. Westerham,
if you please, must go nosing around the
garage in Rupert Street to find out where his car
is. It had gone, of course, to Holyhead as the
result of my instructions. The manager wired to
the chauffeur at Chester to return to town at once.
But I wired to Birmingham to stop it there. Crow
went down and dismissed the chauffeur, saying that
he came from Westerham. The car is now in
Chelsea, and we shall have the pleasure of using it
to-day. It is just the car we want, because for
some reason or other Westerham had it fitted with
blind shutters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame nodded her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will telephone to Westminster and get the
car to meet us at Oxford Circus. You can go down
to Downing Street, and I will take a taxicab to
the Star and Garter, Richmond. When you get
to No. 10 simply ask for the Lady Kathleen, but
give no name and refuse your business. That will
merely arouse her curiosity, and the fact that you
come in such a car will certainly obtain you an
audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun then went on to give Madame various instructions,
enjoining her not to talk to Lady Kathleen
on the way down to Richmond.</p>

<p>They then took a cab to Oxford Circus together
and telephoned from the District Messengers' office
to the garage at Chelsea for the car to come
on to them at once at Pagani's.</p>

<p>It was shortly after twelve o'clock when Westerham's
car reached the famous restaurant in Great
Portland Street.</p>

<p>Melun, as he took leave of Mme. Estelle, again
enjoined her to silence; and though Madame promised
that she would not discuss his affairs with
Lady Kathleen, she was, if the truth were told,
not quite decided whether she would keep her
word.</p>

<p>Her arrival in Downing Street occasioned a little
surprise and not a little curiosity on the part of the
doorkeeper when she refused to give her name.
Without much delay, however, she was shown into
the long, old-fashioned drawing-room, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
not many minutes before Lady Kathleen appeared.</p>

<p>Kathleen came into the room very quietly. The
sudden alarms and excursions amid which she had
lately lived were accustoming her to strange and
unexpected events, and she instinctively guessed
that the woman who awaited her in the drawing-room
was in some way connected with her father's
secret.</p>

<p>As she entered the room Mme. Estelle rose from
her seat and bowed. She did not attempt to shake
hands, nor, indeed, did Lady Kathleen make any
demonstration of friendship.</p>

<p>During the short drive from Oxford Street Madame
had rehearsed her little part to herself. Now
she played it perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia needs you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Kathleen's face paled, and she drew back a step.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't quite understand,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Madame smiled in quite a charming way. &#8220;Lady
Kathleen,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I cannot explain very much,
for I know very little. I was simply requested by
the Russian Embassy to inform you that a special
emissary from St. Petersburg asks to see you at
once. Who he is,&#8221; Madame continued, shrugging
her shoulders, &#8220;I really cannot say. Sometimes,
you know, the Russian officials are mysterious, and
I have only my work to do. I ask no questions; it
is not my business.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this gentleman, whoever he may be, is
seemingly fearful of being seen in London, and he
has asked you to meet me at Richmond in an
hour's time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whereabouts in Richmond?&#8221; asked Kathleen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;At the Star and Garter Hotel. I was asked to
assure you that in all probability he would not
detain you long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen's heart now beat faster with hope and
now slowly with fear. When she had left the
Czar's cousin at Rouen that great personage had
given no indication that there was anything further
to be discussed. He had simply delivered his ultimatum
and taken his way back to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;you do not know
whether this gentleman would be likely to wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am instructed,&#8221; replied Mme. Estelle, &#8220;that
he cannot possibly wait. He is catching the three-o'clock
mail back to France.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certainly an exceedingly awkward position
for a girl to be in. Hitherto she had undertaken
no negotiations with the Czar's agents except on
the advice of her father, and it seemed a remarkable
thing that she should be sent for in this way
in person.</p>

<p>That she could disturb her father was, of course,
out of the question, and with some misgivings she
decided that it would be best to accompany her
mysterious visitor without further delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be with you in a few moments,&#8221; she
said, and passed out of the room to put on her
outdoor things.</p>

<p>When she returned she found Madame already
on her feet, as though anxious to depart&#8212;and anxious
to depart she was.</p>

<p>From the beginning Mme. Estelle had cherished
no liking for her mission, and the sight of Kathleen's
pale and troubled beauty had unnerved her
not a little. The place oppressed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>She admitted to herself that her notions were
entirely fanciful, but still the whole atmosphere of
the rather sombre and old-fashioned drawing-room
seemed charged with tragedy.</p>

<p>Kathleen preceded her visitor down the stairs,
and then they entered the car. It was the Premier's
official attendant who opened and shut the
door of the motor for them. The chauffeur was
apparently busy with the machinery, his head inside
the bonnet.</p>

<p>Whatever small trouble the man was encountering
with the engines was of short duration, for
Kathleen had scarcely settled herself in her seat before
the car began to move.</p>

<p>As the big motor car swung round into Whitehall
a second car entered Downing Street and had
to draw up short in order to avoid a collision.
Kathleen, thinking that an accident was unavoidable,
leant forward and looked out of the window,
and, to her astonishment, she discerned the face of
Westerham in the other car.</p>

<p>She drew back again with an exclamation, and
though she set it down as imagination at the time,
she had no doubt afterwards that as a matter of
fact Mme. Estelle had become deathly pale.</p>

<p>The car proceeded at a rapid rate up Whitehall
and turning along Pall Mall made its way into
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The run to Richmond was a smooth one, unmarked
by any incident, and for the most part,
both the women were profoundly silent.</p>

<p>Each, indeed, was occupied with her own
thoughts. Mme. Estelle, as she cast furtive and
sidelong glances at Lady Kathleen, became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
jealous and a little more disinclined to believe
Melun's protestations at every mile.</p>

<p>She would have given much to be able to ask
Lady Kathleen point-blank whether or not Melun
had made a marriage with her one of the conditions
which he was seeking to foist on the Prime
Minister. But she had the good sense to see that
even a tentative question of this sort would instantly
arouse Lady Kathleen's suspicions. Even
as the pseudo agent of the Russian Government
her knowledge of affairs could not be supposed to
include a matter such as this.</p>

<p>Kathleen, for her part, had spent the time in trying
to account for Westerham's presence in Downing
Street. Presumably he was about to make
some further effort to persuade her father of his
<i>bona fides</i>. And she grew more unhappy as she
thought what her father's answer would again inevitably
be, and could only pray that Westerham
might have sufficient forbearance to persevere in
spite of the Premier's certain rudeness.</p>

<p>Presently Kathleen, watching from the window,
saw the familiar shape of the Star and Garter come
into view. Slightly to her surprise the motor-car
did not slacken its speed, but went on through the
gates of Richmond Park. Then, almost for the
first time, she spoke to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man must have made a mistake,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;he has passed the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he?&#8221; asked Madame, with an air of astonishment.
&#8220;That is rather strange. He must
know the way. Perhaps there is something wrong
with the machinery.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lady Kathleen shook her head, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
knew enough of motoring to appreciate the steady
purr of an engine which is running well.</p>

<p>Suddenly the brakes were applied with considerable
force and the car came to a rapid standstill.</p>

<p>Then the door swung open and a man leaped in.</p>

<p>Almost instantly he pulled up the blind shutters
which covered the glass and shut out all the light,
so that the interior of the car was in complete
darkness.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a little cry and shrank back
against the cushions. For in the darkness she felt
the car give a great bound onwards and rush down
the hill.</p>

<p>She heard a low laugh, and then the scraping of
a hand as it fumbled for the electric button.</p>

<p>The hand groping in the darkness found the
switch and flooded the car with light.</p>

<p>Kathleen sat bolt upright and uttered a second
cry as she saw grinning at her from the opposite
side of the car the evil face of Melun.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br /><span class="smaller">THE FARM ON THE HILL</span></a></h2>


<p>For a while Kathleen was too bewildered to say
anything, but soon one ugly fact stood out hard
and convincing. She had been betrayed.</p>

<p>Slowly she gathered all her mental resources
together and slowly she looked from Melun to
Marie Estelle and back to Melun.</p>

<p>During the past few weeks she had learned to
expect infamy and even treachery, but she had not
looked for any action so villainous as this.</p>

<p>As the car went bounding down the hill at an
ever-increasing rate of speed Kathleen saw Melun
give an appreciative nod to the woman at her side,
and she watched a little smile of triumph flit across
the woman's mouth.</p>

<p>Kathleen could only dimly wonder what this new
move meant. That she had been kidnapped she
could not doubt, but for precisely what purpose
she could not understand, though she judged that
she had been taken prisoner with the idea of hurrying
Lord Penshurst to a decision.</p>

<p>The first shock of Melun's entry over, Kathleen
steeled herself against all fear, and calling her
pride to her assistance disdained to ask any questions.</p>

<p>The silence in the electric-lighted car became,
indeed, so oppressive that Melun, who had been
waiting for some passionate outburst on Kathleen's
part, could bear it no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, looking at her with an
insolent sneer, &#8220;that I owe you an apology for being
compelled to treat you in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Kathleen made no answer; she only looked
at him with scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I consider it was well
and neatly done,&#8221; continued Melun. &#8220;Excellently
planned and excellently carried out. My congratulation
to you,&#8221; and again he gave Mme. Estelle
a little nod.</p>

<p>Once more there was silence, but it was Kathleen
who broke it now. She was determined to
carry the war into the enemy's camp. If she could
achieve nothing else, she could at least, by showing
a mingled boldness and resignation, cause Melun
considerable uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have put up these things&#8221;&#8212;and
she tapped lightly with her fingers against the blind
shutters&#8212;&#8220;because you were afraid that I might
scream or struggle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is precisely the case,&#8221; said Melun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need have no fear of that,&#8221; returned
Kathleen. &#8220;I give you my word that I will neither
call out nor attempt to escape. The women of
my family are in the habit of acting bravely and
openly.&#8221;</p>

<p>She intended this as a covert hit at Mme. Estelle,
and apparently the shot went home, for she
saw the woman redden a little and slightly turn
away her head.</p>

<p>Melun gave Kathleen one quick, shrewd glance
and then lowered the shutters; and Kathleen, looking
almost lazily out of the window, saw that they
were now almost clear of the park, and, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
she could judge by the position of the sun, were
running towards the southwest.</p>

<p>The drive continued in complete silence. Mme.
Estelle remained red and awkward, Melun was
morose and ill at ease. Kathleen alone was self-possessed,
though pale. She even forbore to ask
whither they were bound, for though sadly tempted
to do so, she checked herself with the rather sad
reflection that she would know sooner or later.</p>

<p>By-and-by they drew near to a considerable town,
and Melun, in spite of Kathleen's promise, drew
the blind shutters up once more.</p>

<p>He had, however, the grace to be moderately
apologetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not because I distrust your word, Lady
Kathleen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but because I have to take
precautions. One does not know who might
happen to look into the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before Melun lowered the shutters
again, and Kathleen's heart gave a little thump,
for looking out on the country she realised that
she was on a familiar road. She recognised the
high hedges between which they were running as
those which border the long lane running between
Croydon and Hayes Common.</p>

<p>The car began to shoot up-hill, and they went
over a breezy heath, subsequently running down
into the valley, as Kathleen judged, of Farnborough.</p>

<p>For a little while they kept to the main road and
then turned off to the left again. Half an hour's
run brought them to Westerham&#8212;from which
place Sir Paul took his title.</p>

<p>As the car turned to the left once more Kathleen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
had little doubt that they were bound for
Sevenoaks; nor was she wrong.</p>

<p>But the car did not stop here; it swept past the
Royal Crown Hotel, past the old Grammar School,
past the wooded stretch of Knole Park, down the
steep and tortuous River Hill.</p>

<p>At Hildenborough the car turned up to the right
and raced through the Weald of Kent. This was
all familiar ground to Kathleen, and she realised
that to some extent they were doubling on their
tracks, making a zigzag course along the valley at
the base of Ide and Toys Hill.</p>

<p>Suddenly the car stopped, and Kathleen, looking
through the open window, saw the chauffeur get
down from the seat and open a gate which apparently
led to a more private path.</p>

<p>Through this the car passed and was swallowed
up in a wood. But the jolting and rattling over
ruts soon ceased, the road widened and became
smooth, and they began to climb in curves up the
face of a steep hill.</p>

<p>By-and-by they came to a small plateau on the
edge of which was an old farmhouse. The ground
dropped almost sheer away from it at the southern
end, while almost the whole of the front of it was
washed by a muddy and apparently deep pool.</p>

<p>As they drew up before the little low doorway
Kathleen heard several great dogs baying at different
points.</p>

<p>The chauffeur got down from his seat again and
drew near to open the door. Then for the first
time Kathleen, with a sinking of her heart, recognised
the man as Crow.</p>

<p>The short winter's day had now drawn to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
close, and as he entered the house Melun ordered
the lamps to be lit.</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle led the way into a not ill-furnished
dining-room, the window of which projected over
the vast cliff.</p>

<p>To reach this room they had traversed a long
passage, and Kathleen appreciated the fact that
the house was very curiously built. It consisted,
indeed, of two portions, which were linked together
by a long stone-flagged corridor.</p>

<p>Melun helped himself liberally to neat brandy.
Mme. Estelle sent for Crow and told him to order
tea.</p>

<p>Kathleen had been filled with an intense foreboding
as she entered the house, a foreboding which
increased as she slowly recognised that she and
Mme. Estelle were apparently the only women in
the place.</p>

<p>For the tea was brought in by a man, not a
farmhand or an honest countryman, but a villainous-looking
individual with a pock-marked face and
little gold earrings in the lobes of his frost-bitten
ears. He walked with his feet wide apart, and
with a slightly rolling gait. He had an immense
bull neck, and the hands with which he grasped the
tray were large, grimy and hairy. Kathleen set
him down as a sailor; nor was she wrong.</p>

<p>When tea was over Melun lit a cigarette, and
drawing Mme. Estelle on one side conversed with
her for some time in whispers.</p>

<p>At the end of the whispered conference between
Melun and Mme. Estelle the woman left the room
without so much as a word to Kathleen or even a
glance in her direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Melun turned round with a baleful light in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can have this
matter out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen's afflictions had only increased her old
habit of command and her natural dignity. Though
in reality she was the prisoner, she might have
been the captor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you speak, Captain Melun,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I also have something to say. How long do you
intend to keep me here? I ask this, not for my
own sake, but for my father's.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Melun, with a malicious grin, &#8220;depends
entirely on your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By this time, of course,&#8221; Kathleen continued,
&#8220;a great hue-and-cry will have been raised after
me in London. Do you intend to return there to-night?
Again I ask this question for my father's
sake. He should be informed of my whereabouts
at once; for you must remember that he is an
old man and will probably take this very much to
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not be informed of this to-night,&#8221; said
Melun, shortly. &#8220;Because,&#8221; he continued, with a
villainous leer, &#8220;I am only cruel to be kind. I
want to have all the details of your ransom and
our marriage settled as soon as possible. A night
of waiting will soften your dear old father's heart,
and he will probably listen to reason in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen shuddered and drew a little further
away from Melun. &#8220;You coward,&#8221; she said, and
looked at him with infinite contempt.</p>

<p>Again a dangerous light leapt into Melun's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;what names you
call me here. I do not wish to be compelled to
make you feel your position. But if necessary I
shall&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen did not take her scornful eyes from
his face, and Melun at last looked shiftily away.</p>

<p>As he apparently did not intend to speak again,
Kathleen put to him another question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the woman,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;you employed
to get me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no business of yours,&#8221; snarled Melun,
&#8220;though you can, if you wish to speak to or allude
to her, call her Mme. Estelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I merely asked,&#8221; said Kathleen, &#8220;because I
was curious to know how she came to make use of
the name of Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was simple, perfectly simple. It was largely
a matter of guesswork. It was only natural to
suppose that you would be doing what you could
to smooth matters over with the Czar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded a little to herself. There were
apparently few details of her father's secret with
which Melun was not acquainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the captain, changing his tone and
attempting to be brisk and businesslike, &#8220;let us for
a moment consider the essential points of the case.
Of the ransom, of course, there can be no question.
I shall increase the sum because of the obstinate
way in which your father has refused my overtures.
That, however, will be all the better for
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said this with an insinuating air for which
Kathleen loathed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The only remaining obstacle is yourself. But
you, perhaps, will no longer refuse the hand which
I so considerately offer you in marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Melun,&#8221; said Kathleen, coldly, &#8220;you
are at liberty to discuss the business side of this
matter as much as you please. But I decline altogether
to allow you to insult me. After all, it is
unnecessary, for I have nothing to say on the
matter, and must refer you to my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; said Melun, &#8220;that I might be
able to gladden his heart with the news of your
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen turned her back on him, and Melun
swore at her without disguise. But she paid no
heed.</p>

<p>Presently he walked round the room so that he
could come face to face with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is early,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but early hours will do
you good. If you will be so kind as to accompany
me I will show you to your room.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way up three flights of stairs till they
came to a small landing. Out of this there opened
only one door, and through this Melun passed.</p>

<p>Kathleen now found herself in a large, square
room, simply and yet fairly well furnished, partly
as a bedroom and partly as a sitting-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is here,&#8221; said Melun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> &#8220;that I am unfortunately
compelled to ask you to await your father's
decision. However, I release you unconditionally
from your promise neither to scream nor to attempt
escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are at perfect liberty to scream to your
heart's content. There is no one here who will
mind in the least. You are also at perfect liberty
to make what efforts at escape you choose. I fear
that you will only find them futile.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out quickly and closed the door after
him. Kathleen, listening in the badly-lighted room,
could hear a key grate in the lock and bolts shot
in both at the top and the bottom of the door.</p>

<p>Quickly and methodically she made an examination
of her prison. She looked into the cupboards
and into the drawers and the massive
bureau. But there was nothing about the room of
the remotest interest to her which offered the faintest
suggestion, sinister or otherwise.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, only when she looked out of the
windows, of which there were three, that she discovered
to the full how utterly helpless was her
position.</p>

<p>The window on the south side was apparently
over the window of the dining-room, and, as she
peeped over the sill, looked sheer down the face
of the precipice beneath her.</p>

<p>The west window, she found, looked down into
a stone courtyard, while the window on the east
overhung the pond. Apparently she was imprisoned
in a tower.</p>

<p>When Melun had reached the ground floor he
sought out Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not had much opportunity of saying
anything to you,&#8221; he remarked as he entered the
room in which she was sitting, &#8220;but I should like
to tell you now how splendidly you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame was restless and ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had seen that girl before to-day,&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
&#8220;I should never have brought her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you would have been a fool,&#8221; said Melun,
rudely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly, but still, even at the risk of your displeasure,
there are a few things which I do not
care to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun glanced at her sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;it is too late now.
I have made up my mind, and we will go through
with it, but frankly, I don't like this business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Melun; &#8220;it will not last
for ever. To-morrow ought to settle it. I shall go
back to town the first thing, starting at about five
o'clock, as I shall have to make a <i>détour</i>. I have
changed the number of the car, but still it is hard
to say what Westerham may be up to. If he finds
that his precious motor has not come back to town
he may take to advertising it as stolen&#8212;which
would be awkward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame at this point bade Melun good-night,
and the captain sent for Crow. To him he gave
instructions to have the car ready at five o'clock,
but told him that he should drive it back to town
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can serve a better purpose by remaining
here,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> &#8220;For, mark you, I will have no
hanky-panky games in this house in my absence.
And, mark you, too, I have no desire to have Mme.
Estelle and Lady Kathleen becoming too friendly.
You never can rely on women. They are funny
creatures, and Madame is far too sympathetic with
the girl already. So I shall look to you to stop
anything of that sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the rest, you will know what to do if certain
contingencies should arise. I have not brought
the dogs here for nothing.&#8221; He broke off and
shuddered a little himself as at some short distance
from the house he could hear the baying of the
great hounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are loose, I suppose?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Crow nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Heaven help the stranger,&#8221; he rejoined
with a cruel laugh, and pulling a rug over himself
he lay down to sleep on the sofa.</p>

<p>He was up betimes in the morning, and had, indeed,
been gone four hours when Mme. Estelle
came lazily down to breakfast.</p>

<p>Melun had left no instructions in regard to
Kathleen's food, and as she did not consider it advisable
to let the unfortunate girl starve, Madame,
after she had herself breakfasted, set a tray with
the intention of carrying it up to Kathleen's room.</p>

<p>Before she could do this, however, it was necessary
to send for Crow in order to obtain the key.</p>

<p>When she asked for it, Crow shifted uneasily
from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have very strict orders,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Madame demanded
sharply. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply that the master said that you and the
young lady were not to get talking too much. He
said nothing about food, or of waiting on her ladyship,
and it didn't occur to me until this morning
that it was a bit of a rum job for a chap like myself
to wait on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he added, with a smirk, &#8220;I don't
so much mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Crow's clumsy utterances had again aroused
all Madame's sleeping suspicions. There was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
moreover, no reason why she should keep silence
now. Her treachery was a different matter altogether.
The way was smooth for asking Kathleen
the question the answer to which meant so much
to her.</p>

<p>She laughed in Crow's face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was hardly necessary for the captain to give
you any orders, seeing that he gave certain instructions
to me. He said that as there was no other
woman in the house it would be my place to take
Lady Kathleen anything that she actually needed.
I am going to take up her breakfast now. Give me
the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crow hesitated a moment, but finally handed
over the key. Madame put it on the breakfast tray
and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Kathleen, as she heard the bolts drawn back and
the key turned in the lock, suffered fresh apprehension.
For she had caught the rustle of Madame's
skirts outside, and she would rather have faced
Melun than the woman.</p>

<p>With very little apology Mme. Estelle entered,
and, setting the breakfast down, immediately withdrew.
Her impatience to ask the question was
great, but she schooled herself to waiting.</p>

<p>In half an hour's time she went up for the tray,
and then she faced Kathleen boldly and looked her
in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Kathleen,&#8221; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> &#8220;I am really
ashamed to have brought you here in such a
treacherous way. I will not ask you to forgive
me, for you will not understand. I can only
tell you that I am a very loving and jealous
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle paused, and was conscious that
Kathleen looked at her in great surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;to ask you a question
which means much to me. Is it, or is it not, one
of Captain Melun's conditions that you shall
marry him before he returns your father's secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Kathleen, very quietly, &#8220;it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame's rather flushed face grew white, and
her eyes blazed with passion. She clenched her
fists and beat the air with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the liar!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;the liar! Oh! it is
hard to be treated like this when I have done so
much for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen drew back, startled and amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you that you need have no fear so far
as I am concerned. Both my father and myself
have refused to comply with that condition, and
we shall refuse to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame, however, paid but little heed to Kathleen;
she was beside herself with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ah!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;wait till he returns! I'll
kill him! I'll kill him!&#8221;</p>

<p>So distorted with fury was the woman's face
that Kathleen became alarmed for her sanity. She
drew near to her and endeavoured to catch her
hands in her own, imploring her to be calm.</p>

<p>By-and-by Mme. Estelle listened to her, and in
a sudden revulsion of feeling fell on her knees,
sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>Kathleen bent over her, doing her best to console
her, and presently, as the woman grew calmer, she
endeavoured to turn the situation to her own and
her father's advantage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to defeat Captain Melun's
scheme, so far as I am concerned,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;is
to release me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that Mme. Estelle leaped to her feet again
and her face was hideous in its cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! not that,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;not that! If I distrust
him, I distrust you still more. Your pretty
face may look sad and sorrowful, and you may
declare to me that you will never consent; but I
will wait and see. I'll wait until Melun returns
and confront you with him. Then perhaps I shall
learn the real truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kathleen made a little despairing gesture with
her hands; argument, she saw, would be useless.</p>

<p>Gathering herself together, Madame blundered,
half blind with tears, out of the room, and Kathleen
with a sinking heart heard the bolts drawn
again.</p>

<p>All through the day Madame sat brooding, sending
Kathleen's lunch and tea up to her by Crow.</p>

<p>All the evening she still sat and brooded, until
as eleven o'clock drew near and there were still no
signs of the captain she had worked herself up into
a hysteria of rage.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock struck, and still the captain was
absent. Another half-hour dragged slowly by, and
then she heard his car grating its way up the hill-side.</p>

<p>She was at the door to meet him, and would have
plunged straightway into the matter which absorbed
her but for the sight of his face.</p>

<p>It was haggard and pale as death. His eyes
were blazing in their sockets, and his straggling
hair lent him altogether a distraught and terrifying
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Melun!&#8221; cried the woman, stretching out her
hand, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; he said hoarsely; &#8220;I wish I did,
but the Premier's gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is lost. Westerham kidnapped him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, you fool!&#8221; shouted the captain,
irritably. &#8220;It's true&#8212;perfectly true!&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked into the hall and sank exhausted
into a chair. &#8220;As for me,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;I have
had the narrowest escape I ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that's all, is it?&#8221; cried Mme. Estelle, remembering
her own grievance. &#8220;So that's all!</p>

<p>&#8220;But what of me? What do you think I have
gone through? What do you think I have
suffered? What do you think I have found out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melun rose unsteadily from his chair and looked
at her in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Lady Kathleen?&#8221; he asked; &#8220;is she
safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe! Oh, yes, she is safe,&#8221; she cried, with a
peal of uncanny laughter. &#8220;Safe for your kisses
and for your caresses. Oh, you liar! you liar! I
have been true to you in all respects, and you have
been false to me in everything that mattered. So
you will marry the pretty Lady Kathleen, will you?
Oh, but you won't! Never! Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rushed at Melun as though to strike him,
but Melun, jaded though he was, was quick and
strong.</p>

<p>He caught her brutally, as he might a dog, by
the neck, and threw her into the dining-room, the
door of which stood open, and, utterly careless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to what harm he might do to her, sent the unhappy
woman sprawling on to the floor. In a second he
had banged the door to and turned the key in the
lock. He sank down on to the bench trembling
and exhausted.</p>

<p>He heard Marie pick herself up and hurl herself
in blind and impotent fury against the door.</p>

<p>He listened, shaking like a leaf, as shriek after
shriek of frenzy reached his ears.</p>

<p>Up in the tower Kathleen heard these shrieks
too, and shuddered. A horrible fear took possession
of her heart that there was murder being done
below.</p>

<p>She sat on the edge of her bed with her hands
pressed to her heart, listening in fascinated horror.</p>

<p>The shrieks died away, and there was complete
silence in the house for full half an hour.</p>

<p>Then Kathleen heard a sudden shout, a crashing
of glass and a scrambling, tearing noise, the hideous
bay of the boarhounds in the courtyard, a
scream, and a thud.</p>

<p>Stabbing the other noise with sharp precision
came the sound of shots.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class="smaller">THE KIDNAPPING OF THE PRIME MINISTER</span></a></h2>


<p>&#8220;Out of evil cometh good.&#8221; Had Westerham
caught the eye of Kathleen as the two motor cars
passed each other at the corner of Whitehall Kathleen
herself would have been spared much suffering
and several men would not have gone to their
account. But a meeting at that moment would
have so changed the whole course of events that
far greater trouble would have befallen, and the
whole earth might have become involved in a disaster
which would have grown, without question,
into Armageddon.</p>

<p>It was, however, in happy ignorance of both the
greater and the lesser evil that Westerham, in what
were really most excellent spirits, drew up the car
which he had borrowed from Dunton at No. 10
Downing Street.</p>

<p>With him came Mendip, the younger of the two
men whom he had met in such curious circumstances
at the gaming club on the night when Kathleen
had staked her father's honour against the
bank and, for the time, lost.</p>

<p>Mendip was one of those strange, tired men who
appear to do nothing and yet accomplish much. He
was slow of speech, but quick in action when occasion
demanded; silent, serious, and of a character
built to bear with resolution any temptation or
trial which might arise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Dunton trusted him implicitly, and, in spite of
his short acquaintance with him, Westerham trusted
him too.</p>

<p>A third person had been necessary for the enterprise,
and had been found in the person of
Tom Lowther, a good-natured young giant, who
laughed his way through what, to him, was a
laughing world.</p>

<p>It was with an immense grin of satisfaction that
he had taken on his shoulders the task of driving
the car in which Westerham set out on his desperate
enterprise.</p>

<p>Dunton had left his chambers early in the morning,
so that about eleven o'clock all the men who
had been selected to drag the Premier's secret from
him had gathered in Dunton's rooms.</p>

<p>There, half humorously, Westerham had explained
the project to them, basing his argument
upon a lesson drawn from an abortive raid which
certain suffragettes had made upon the official
residence not long before.</p>

<p>What woman could attempt, he had argued, man
could decidedly accomplish.</p>

<p>So the plan was mapped out; and according to
the arrangements which Westerham made, Lowther
backed the car round in Downing Street and
drew it up alongside the curb, so that its head
pointed towards Whitehall, and, as Westerham
hoped, the high road of escape.</p>

<p>It was astonishing that, in spite of the suffragettes'
attempt on Downing Street, more precautions
were not taken. For all he knew, Westerham
might have had to encounter worse opposition than
he did. But he was prepared for all emergencies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and, moreover, determined not to spare drastic
measures if it came to a tight corner.</p>

<p>As he drew up to the door, Westerham hoped
that the immaculate Dunton might play his part
as well as he intended to play his own. Dunton
had gone down to Chichester, and had ordered
his yacht to await him in the fair way off Selsey
Bill.</p>

<p>It was to Dunton's yacht that Westerham determined
to take the Premier.</p>

<p>As the car came to a standstill, Westerham and
Mendip alighted quickly, and without hesitation
pulled the little brass knob at No. 10. As they
expected, the door was pulled open quickly, and the
head, followed by the figure, of the Premier's
official door-keeper appeared in the entry.</p>

<p>Westerham was first up the steps, with Mendip
hard at his heels.</p>

<p>He pushed the man aside, and had slammed the
door to in the twinkling of an eye. He thrust the
man back into the deep, cane-hooded chair in which
he was wont to sit and dream away his official
hours, and had him gagged before he had time to
cry out. Then, by means of the straps with which
he had provided himself, he and Mendip securely
lashed the man's feet together, tying his hands behind
his back.</p>

<p>This work done, they paused and listened; but,
in spite of the scuffle there had been, there was no
sound of approaching footsteps, nor, indeed, any
sign that they had been overheard.</p>

<p>Without a word, Westerham grasped the man
by the shoulders, and Mendip took him by the heels;
and so they carried him through the red-baize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
swing-doors which formed the entrance to the passage
leading to the council chamber.</p>

<p>There, with no ceremony at all, they dropped
him on the ground, and ran quickly down the
corridor.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this there stood a door, which
opened easily as Westerham turned the handle.</p>

<p>They then found themselves in a somewhat
ellipse-shaped vestibule, which, as a matter of fact,
was the outer lobby of the room where the Cabinet
Council was being held.</p>

<p>That the door of the council chamber would be
locked Westerham knew full well; but he had
come prepared to overcome any difficulty of this
kind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he turned the handle, only to find,
as he had expected, that the key on the inner side
had been turned.</p>

<p>When in America, Westerham had found it
necessary to force more than one door; and now he
pursued the tactics which he had found efficacious
on previous occasions.</p>

<p>Swiftly he drew his own revolver from his hip-pocket
and held out his other hand for Mendip's.
Mendip, with his eyes beaming, passed his own
weapon to Westerham without a word.</p>

<p>He then placed the noses of both the six-shooters
on the woodwork just above the lock, pointing them
downwards so that no damage might be done to
the ministers within. He pulled the triggers simultaneously,
and the sound of splintered woodwork
and riven iron followed instantaneously on the
double report.</p>

<p>The door all about the lock was shattered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
matchwood, and Westerham, thrusting his foot
forward, pushed it open.</p>

<p>Mendip sprang back in fear lest his face should
be recognised by any of the startled ministers,
while Westerham strode calmly into the room.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Council was in full session about
a long oval table.</p>

<p>The Premier, who sat opposite the door, had
risen from his seat, and with a white face was
staring directly into Westerham's eyes.</p>

<p>The other ministers had thrust back their chairs,
and were now upon their feet. There was complete
silence.</p>

<p>Westerham had not the slightest fear of any of
them being armed, and without a pause walked
over to the table and knocked sharply with the
butt of his revolver on the polished wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I wish to
speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's jaw opened and closed
spasmodically, so that his white beard wagged upon
his breast. He made no answer.</p>

<p>Silently the other ministers drew aside into two
groups, leaving Westerham and the Premier facing
each other in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>With an effort, Lord Penshurst got the better of
his agitated nerves and rapped out a sharp &#8220;What
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst,&#8221; said Westerham, calmly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
&#8220;you know who I am. You know on what mission
I am here. If you refuse to come round the table
to speak to me instantly and speak to me
alone I cannot be held responsible for the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier, without a word and with trailing
steps began to make the circuit of the long table.
As he approached, Westerham drew back so that
now he was at the entrance to the council chamber.
He beckoned Lord Penshurst still nearer.</p>

<p>When the Premier was quite close to him he
stooped and whispered into his ear so that none
of the other ministers could by any chance catch
his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to save Lady Kathleen and yourself,
you must come with me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst said, &#8220;It's impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't argue,&#8221; urged Westerham, almost
roughly. &#8220;I regret to treat you with so much disrespect,
but the crisis for which you have been
waiting has now come. If you lose, you know what
it will mean. But you need not lose if you will
follow me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this conversation the startled ministers
had drawn together, and there was considerable
outcry as Lord Penshurst turned to look at them
with a white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quick,&#8221; said Westerham; &#8220;you must keep
them quiet for about five minutes. Five minutes
will do, but we must have that start. Don't fail,
everything depends upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the Premier, slowly and painfully,
as a man speaking in a dream;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> &#8220;gentlemen,
I must apologise for this interruption, but I assure
you that the fault must not be laid at the door of
this gentleman, but at mine. In five minutes I will
return. In the meantime I have to discuss more
important business than any which could detain me
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ministers looked at each other, utterly
aghast. It was fortunate that Westerham's entry
had been so swift and so volcanic that they were
still partially dazed. Otherwise it might have been
necessary for Westerham to take steps entailing
consequences which no influence, however great,
could possibly have averted.</p>

<p>As it was, they gazed at the Premier and the tall
form of Westerham, sullenly and stupidly.</p>

<p>One of them, a younger man than the rest, suddenly
remembered and cried out: &#8220;By George, it
is the man who saved us all at the dance!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other ministers looked at their colleague,
with inquiry; but it was an inquiry as to the meaning
of the stranger's presence, and not as to his
exclamation. For the raid on Trant Hall was now
a matter of public knowledge and consuming public
interest.</p>

<p>Doubtless, but for the unimpeachable reputation
of the Premier, some of them would have cried out
that this was a traitorous piece of work. But in
spite of all the appearances against him, Lord
Penshurst's colleagues were silent on this point.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Premier had practically given
his consent, Westerham grasped him by the arm
and at a rapid rate half dragged him down the
corridor.</p>

<p>As they passed the bound and gagged porter,
who looked up with wondering and bewildered eyes
at his master as he was dragged past him, the
Premier could not refrain from uttering a little
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the man,&#8221; said Westerham in his
ear, and hurried him on. He left him standing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the red-baize door for a moment as he dashed back
to turn the key in the lock of the inner vestibule.
But before the Premier had an opportunity of
protesting against this, Westerham was back at
his side and hastening him across the hall.</p>

<p>In the hall Westerham looked rapidly about him.
It struck him that the appearance of the Prime
Minister being rushed hatless across the pavement
to the motor-car might arouse curiosity on the part
of the policeman who was slouching up and down
along the pavement.</p>

<p>He saw Lord Penshurst's hat, snatched it up,
jammed it on the Premier's head, and then, again
stifling every protest on the part of the old man
by curtly ordering him to be silent, ran him down
the steps and across the pavement to the car.</p>

<p>By a miracle the policeman's back was, for the
moment, turned to No. 10, so that it was without
the slightest let or hindrance that Westerham and
Mendip bundled the Premier into the car and
that Lowther started the motor on its long journey.</p>

<p>So swift and overwhelming had been Westerham's
attack that the aged Premier was still too
overcome to demand any explanation or to ask any
questions. He leant back against the upholstery,
looking crushed and frail, so frail that Westerham's
heart smote him for the violence that he had been
forced to use. But he nerved himself to carry the
thing through, comforting himself with the reflection
that what he did must prove the salvation of
Kathleen.</p>

<p>The car which Lowther drove was a hired one,
but he was an expert driver, and made good speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
down Victoria Street to the Buckingham Palace
Road and over the Albert Bridge. In less than
fifteen minutes he had reached Battersea Park.</p>

<p>Here he pulled up in a quiet spot and Westerham,
opening the door of the motor-car, turned to
Lord Penshurst.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I am obliged to ask
you to walk, but you see, although it is no more
than a quarter of an hour since we left Downing
Street, the whole of London and Scotland Yard
will by this time be searching for you in all directions.
And if there is to be any hope of my being
able to help you out of your difficulties, you must
not be recognised.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier mumbled in his beard, but was still
too dazed to make any resistance. He followed
Westerham out of the car, and suffered Mendip
to take his arm.</p>

<p>A fourth man had been idling by the side of the
path when the car was brought to a standstill.
This was a friend of Lowther's, who had been
pledged to secrecy. He had further promised to
take the car back to the garage, and, if necessary,
to swear that it had been handed over to him by
Lowther on the Barnet Road.</p>

<p>Westerham's subtle mind indeed had thought out
arrangements which practically precluded the possibility
of their track being picked up and followed
with success; though naturally the chances of
escape were very strong against him, for, if ever
the police had worked, they would of a surety work
now.</p>

<p>Westerham led the way through the bushes to
another roadway, on which was waiting a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
car, driven by a second friend of Lowther's on
whom reliance could be placed.</p>

<p>Westerham bundled Mendip and Lord Penshurst
into it, while Lowther climbed up beside his friend.
They lost no time, but drove boldly and rapidly
back along the same route by which they had come
until they arrived at Victoria.</p>

<p>There Lowther gave his friend instructions to
make for Buckingham Palace. Thence they raced
up Constitution Hill into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Lowther had rooms in Stratton Street, which
was immensely in favour of Westerham's hopes,
inasmuch as few pedestrians and fewer vehicles
frequented that aristocratic <i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>

<p>The street when they drew up was fortunately
quite deserted, and Westerham's plans were further
aided by the lucky fact that Lowther's apartments
were on the ground floor. Lowther had given
them free use of his rooms, and as the Premier was
hastily conducted into them he nodded to Westerham
in intimation that his part of the business was
nearly done.</p>

<p>He went out into the street again, and mounting
the car drove away. It had been arranged that he
should make for Salisbury in case he, too, was
followed, and he had immediately agreed to the
proposal, tiresome though it was.</p>

<p>Mendip did not enter the house, but walked
rapidly into Piccadilly, and turning westward,
made for the Automobile Club. There his low-built,
yellow-painted racing motor-car was waiting
for him, and, as he had often done, he took it over
from the charge of his man, and, making a detour
by way of Curzon Street and Piccadilly, got back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to Stratton Street just as Westerham was ready
for him.</p>

<p>In the interval the Premier had somewhat recovered
from the dazed state into which he had
been thrown, and indignantly demanded of Westerham
the meaning of all his man&#339;uvres.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will be good enough to sit down for a
few minutes, Lord Penshurst,&#8221; Westerham said,
&#8220;I think I shall be able to make matters a little
clearer than they are at present.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I told you at Trant, I have no notion what
hold Melun has over you. I can only see that it
must be a hard and a very heavy one. You declined
to believe that I was in reality Sir Paul
Westerham. I cannot prove it to you yet until we
find Lord Dunton. In the meantime, however, I
will ask you if you think that the men who have
assisted me to-day would be willing to do my
bidding if they for a moment suspected that I was
in league with any band of scoundrels.</p>

<p>&#8220;With your own eyes you have seen Lowther
and Mendip. Both men are known to you, both
men are gentlemen, and I think you should take it
for granted that if they are so kind as to assist me
they are satisfied that I am doing what I should.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst wrinkled up his brows. He
could not quite understand how it had come about
that such men as Lowther and Mendip were
apparently working hand-in-glove with Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you have not been so
indiscreet as to make mention of my affairs to these
gentlemen?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever. They have taken the steps
they have because they both trust Dunton to the
utmost. And however much they may have been
influenced by the hope of some fun, they were at
least persuaded that there was a good and serious
purpose at the back of this seemingly harum-scarum
adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst could do nothing but gaze about
him in a most distressed way, and Westerham
sought to give him back his confidence as best he
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you, Lord Penshurst,&#8221; said Westerham,
&#8220;that your only hope is to place yourself
entirely in my hands. There is only one way out
of your troubles; you must tell me the whole of
your story, for I alone can save you. I alone know
Melun, understand him, and know how to deal
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Premier gazed about him wearily.
&#8220;But Dunton,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;where is he? It is all
very well for me to see Lowther and Mendip with
you, but I must have Dunton's word that you are
really the man you say you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Westerham; &#8220;I had already arranged,
thinking that possibly you would prefer to
be out of London, to take you down to Lord
Dunton's yacht which is lying off Selsey Bill.
However, if you prefer it, I will send for Dunton
to come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Premier, &#8220;I think I would
prefer that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night when Dunton arrived
and was shown into Lowther's rooms. Dunton's
story of Westerham was brief and to the point.</p>

<p>At its conclusion the Premier bowed his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
&#8220;I capitulate, Sir Paul,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I will tell
you my secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunton nodded approval and walked out of the
room, leaving Westerham and the Prime Minister
alone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class="smaller">THE PREMIERE'S STORY</span></a></h2>


<p>I have to confess that quite unintentionally I did
my Government and my country a great wrong. In
spite of all my very considerable experience, I did
not see at the time the danger into which I was
drifting, and I had gone too far to draw back when
I realised with a shock the awful position in which
I had placed myself.</p>

<p>As you know, I was drafted into the Ministry
through an rather unusual channel. It is not often
that a diplomat forsakes diplomacy to take part in
politics. An extraordinary combination of events,
however, contrived to place me in a curious position,
with the result that great influence was
brought to bear on me to give up the Embassy of
which I was in charge, and return to England to
take up a minor position in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Probably, in spite of the influence which was
exerted, I should never have consented to do this
but for the fact that I knew the minor position I
was offered was merely a temporary one. I was
given to understand clearly that it was but a
stepping-stone to the Premiership. So I decided
to accept the office.</p>

<p>Now the country from which I returned was
Russia. I was, as you may possibly remember,
Ambassador at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>I was there for many years, and enjoyed an
unusually close and intimate friendship with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Czar. That was at once the beginning of my ambitions
and troubles. It was, indeed, that friendship
which, to a great extent, induced me to transfer
my labours from St. Petersburg to London.</p>

<p>I do not know what acquaintance you may have
of Russian affairs, nor what knowledge you may
have of the Emperor himself. I can only assure
you that, in spite of all that may be said against
him, his Majesty is absolutely sincere and honest
in his desire for universal peace. He suffered untold
agonies of mind during the struggle with
Japan, and since peace was arranged has made use
of every diplomatic means to bring about a general
disarmament by the Powers.</p>

<p>In this aim he met, of course, with most violent
opposition. Some of the Imperial family went so
far as to accuse their kinsman and nominal ruler
of being a traitor to his country.</p>

<p>However, in spite of all opposition, he persevered;
and, as he believed that England was also
sincere in her desire for peace, he cultivated my
acquaintance to a marked degree.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in an evil hour, it suddenly
dawned upon me that my name might be handed
down to posterity, jointly with that of the Czar's,
as the man who paved the way to universal peace.</p>

<p>But my ideas were different from those of the
Czar. His Majesty wished to work along the line
of least resistance, and was quite prepared to spend
years of patient effort in bringing about his dream
of the millennium.</p>

<p>For my part, I was, I suppose, an old man in
a hurry. I could not afford to wait for years to see
the triumph of my schemes. I was getting on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
life, and it seemed to me that if I did not hasten
I might die without my ambition being realised.</p>

<p>I therefore set to work entirely to remodel the
Czar's ideas, and as a result ultimately worked out
the most daring plan for compelling Europe to lay
down its arms that had ever been conceived.</p>

<p>When that plan was fully perfected I was to
take it to my own King and ask for his consent to
it. I knew his Majesty was as genuinely desirous
for peace as the Czar, and I really foresaw no
difficulty in being able to persuade him to sanction
the scheme which I had drawn up.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to go into its full details
here, but perhaps I had better give you a glimpse
of the outline. Briefly, England was to make use
of the <i>entente cordiale</i> to compel France, by means
of an ultimatum which would expire at the end of
twenty-four hours, to consent to stand in with
Great Britain and Russia in a demand that Germany's
military force should be whittled down to
the limits of the Swiss Militia. It was also to be
stipulated that Germany's naval programme should
always be one-half of the combined programmes of
Great Britain, Russia, and France.</p>

<p>Thanks to the treaty with Great Britain made
some years ago with the Scandinavian States, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Spain and
Italy, Germany would have been speedily isolated.
She would have awakened one morning to find herself
absolutely friendless, except, perhaps, for Austria.
It would have been doubtful, too, whether even
Austria would have remained faithful to her pushful
friend when she saw the whole of Europe allied
against the Fatherland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>It was certainly a daring scheme, but one which,
I think, must have met with instantaneous success.
Every aspect of it had been considered, and even
the contingency provided for by the Czar and myself.</p>

<p>Naturally it was impossible to carry the details
of so complicated a piece of business in one's head.
I was half-afraid to commit them to writing myself,
and so the Czar suggested that he should, with
his own hand, draw up the lines of the agreement
which we proposed to foist on Europe.</p>

<p>I brought a copy of the document, made by the
Czar himself, back to this country, and for three
years I waited impatiently for an opportunity to
present the scheme to his Majesty, and, if possible,
persuade him to put it into operation.</p>

<p>Those were three years of terrible anxiety. I
carried the papers with me both day and night.
A hundred times a day I would clap my hands to
my breast-pocket to see if they were safe, and a
score of times I would start up in my bed at night
feverishly to ascertain if I still had them in my
possession.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all my care, I lost them. I kept
the papers in a thin morocco-leather case, which
bore the Imperial arms of Russia. One day I was
looking through them in my room in Downing
Street when I was suddenly informed that I was
wanted at the telephone. Unfortunately, at that
time I had no extension to my room.</p>

<p>I need not particularise as to from whom the
telephone message came. Suffice it to say that it
was a summons which I could not disregard. I
hastily gathered the papers together and, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
thought, thrust them into the breast-pocket of my
coat.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, however, I must have missed
the pocket in my haste, and let the case drop to
the floor.</p>

<p>I was detained longer than I expected at the
telephone, and on going back to my room some
quarter of an hour later, I instinctively felt in my
coat to see if the papers were there.</p>

<p>To my horror they were gone!</p>

<p>I did not dare to excite my household too much,
lest the affair should come to the ears of my colleagues,
and they should begin to wonder what
secret I was keeping to myself.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, was it necessary to make many inquiries.
I asked if there had been any visitors,
and was told that Captain Melun had called, and
had waited some five minutes in my room, but that
he had left before my return, saying that he was
pressed for time just then, but would call later in
the day.</p>

<p>From that moment I had not the slightest doubt
as to where the documents had gone.</p>

<p>I sent for Melun and taxed him with the theft.
He did not deny it.</p>

<p>You may think it rather strange that such a man
as he should have been allowed to enter my house,
but I must explain that I had found his services
exceedingly useful in several matters. He was without
scruple of any kind, and it is often, I regret
to say, convenient for a minister to have some unscrupulous
agent at his disposal.</p>

<p>I ordered Melun to give the papers up, and he
laughed in my face. He told me that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
mastered their contents, and quite appreciated what
they involved.</p>

<p>Indeed, he at once made the most insolent demands.
He told me that I could well afford to pay
him a quarter of a million sterling to get the papers
back. He knew that my wealth was great, and
did not hesitate to blackmail me to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>In the course of long and angry negotiations I
was compelled to agree to pay over this sum. Indeed
I dared not refuse.</p>

<p>He was not, however, content with this rapacious
request. He wanted, he said, to rehabilitate himself
properly in society, and to that end he had
the colossal impudence to demand Lady Kathleen's
hand in marriage.</p>

<p>I tell you frankly, Sir Paul, that I was so furious
at this that I leaped out of my chair, and, old man
though I am, struck Melun across his face.</p>

<p>It was an action which I deeply repented, for,
as compensation, he demanded another fifty thousand
pounds, and again impudently insisted upon
his marriage with my daughter.</p>

<p>This, however, I steadily declined to consider
for a moment. It seemed to me impossible for a
man of Melun's description to fail to be contented
with three hundred thousand pounds. To my dismay,
I found I was mistaken. He repeated over
and over again that I should ultimately consent
to his marrying Lady Kathleen, and threatened
me with exposure and ruin if I still held to my
refusal.</p>

<p>Now I would have gladly faced exposure and
ruin rather than have sacrificed my daughter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
such a despicable hound as this. But, unfortunately,
it was not only my ruin which was involved.</p>

<p>Of a certainty it meant the ruin of British diplomacy,
if not complete disaster to the British Empire.</p>

<p>Disturbances in Russia alarmed the Czar. I sent
Lady Kathleen over to St. Petersburg, and she
urged him to make a personal appeal to our King
to put the plan which I had prepared into instant
action.</p>

<p>At the critical moment the Czar became
thoroughly afraid of what the consequences might
be, and declined to make any move. Moreover, he
wrote me a letter saying that, even at the cost of
Kathleen's marriage to Melun, the papers must be
recovered and returned to him.</p>

<p>All this, of course, occasioned great delay, and
Melun began to press me hard. I made every
effort, most of them legitimate, but some, I fear,
not quite legal, to get the papers back. I had his
rooms searched, and I had the man himself seized
and searched in my presence.</p>

<p>I had his friends and himself all searched on
the same day and at the same hour. It was all to
no purpose. I could not get the faintest clue as to
the whereabouts of the papers.</p>

<p>Then Melun became more menacing than ever.
He demanded £10,000 down and complete immunity
from observation.</p>

<p>And to these requests I had to accede, because
he told me frankly that if I were obstinate he
would at once open up negotiations with Germany.
This, of course, was what I had been dreading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew that if a breath of this business reached
the Kaiser's ears it would be the beginning of the
end. I knew his Imperial Majesty too well to
harbour any hope that he would not strike while
Russia and ourselves were still in disagreement as
to our course of action.</p>

<p>The situation, indeed, was all the more of a nightmare
to me because I had acted without the knowledge
or consent of my King or my colleagues, and
the whole brunt of the blame would have to be
borne by myself.</p>

<p>And what blame it would be! What everlasting
shame and disgrace and misery&#8212;not only for myself,
but for this country!</p>

<p>I am no child in diplomatic matters, and I saw
full well that the moment Germany came into possession
of the facts, the last great fight among the
nations would begin.</p>

<p>That, then, is my story. Four days ago I was
given a week's grace by the Czar in which to recover
the papers or consent to Melun's conditions.
I dare not disobey the Czar's commands, nor is it
possible for me any longer to ignore Melun's request.
At my earnest prayer the Czar sent a special
emissary to me to meet Lady Kathleen at
Rouen.</p>

<p>His Majesty knew that in this matter I had been
compelled to take my daughter into my confidence.
He quite appreciated the necessity for this, and was
indeed most kind about the matter, though he remained
insistent in his terms.</p>

<p>You may judge how terribly concerned he was
when I tell you that the representative he sent was
a member of the Imperial family. And even he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
was not informed of the contents of the papers.</p>

<p>You may realise, too, how desperate my position
is, when I say that I have at last accepted your offer
of help much as a drowning man clutches at a
straw.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class="smaller">A GRISLY THREAT</span></a></h2>


<p>Westerham had listened to Lord Penshurst's long
recital with great attention. From time to time he
raised his eyebrows, but for the rest he gave no
sign of astonishment.</p>

<p>As the Premier concluded Westerham rose and
held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not much time before us, Lord Penshurst,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but I think I can promise you that
you shall have the papers back before the three days
are out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meantime,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;let us get back to
Downing Street at once, and in spite of the sensation
that your continued disappearance will
cause, I think you had better not let it be known
that you are back at your official residence. To do
that would be to allow Melun to suppose that I had
failed in my purpose, and if he thinks that&#8212;then
we shall fail indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The return to Downing Street was made in
Lowther's car, and the Premier entered No. 10
by the back door. There they were met by the
news of Lady Kathleen's disappearance, and the
aged and much-shaken Premier was utterly prostrated
with grief.</p>

<p>The situation, of course, was not only painful,
but dangerous. The news of the disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
of the Prime Minister had created a profound sensation,
not only in England, but abroad, and the
cables all over the world were humming with the
news of the astounding event.</p>

<p>Downing Street had at once been cleared of the
public, but, seeking to allay alarm as far as possible,
those in authority had permitted the representatives
of various newspapers to wait about the house for
tidings. As it was close on midnight and the newspapers
were nearing the approach of the next day's
issue, the reporters were clamouring for some
word.</p>

<p>Westerham therefore decided to take a bold
course, and he issued a short statement to the effect
that the Premier and his daughter had merely left
town for a few days, and that there was not the
slightest cause for public anxiety.</p>

<p>The public, of course, knew better, for practically
every detail of the breaking open of the Cabinet
Council Chamber had been passed from mouth
to mouth. The episode, indeed, was already the
wonder of the age.</p>

<p>Late as was the hour of their return to Downing
Street, Westerham decided on immediate action
in his search for Lady Kathleen, and summoned
help from Scotland Yard. When the inevitable
Mr. Rookley presented himself, Westerham, despite
the terrible anxiety of the moment, could not
restrain a little smile.</p>

<p>Rookley started back as he saw him and his face
blanched. Westerham's explanation, though not
wholly satisfactory to the detective, was to the
point.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would have been better if you had
told me before, Sir Paul,&#8221; the detective grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about that,&#8221; said Westerham,
shortly, &#8220;we must get to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, though he was intensely weary, Westerham
and Rookley, together with Dunton and Mendip,
started for Madame Estelle's villa in St. John's
Wood. Repeated pulls at the bell produced no
response, and so they decided to burst open the
garden gate. This they did, only to find the house
shuttered and in darkness. There was no time for
scruples and, obtaining entrance to the house, they
searched the place from ceiling to roof. There was
no sign of any life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Limehouse!&#8221; cried Westerham. &#8220;We must
try Limehouse!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Limehouse?&#8221; demanded Rookley. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few words Westerham gave Rookley the
history of the crime club and his connection
with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Sir Paul,&#8221; grumbled Rookley, &#8220;I think
we had better engage your services at the Yard;
you seem to know a good deal more about London
than we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I do,&#8221; said Westerham, bitterly.</p>

<p>They started for Limehouse, but on the way
Westerham came to the conclusion that they would
be too late to serve any purpose. It was three
o'clock, and by this time the place would be closed.</p>

<p>Nothing remained, therefore, but to return to
Downing Street and seek a few hours' rest. Westerham,
fully dressed, flung himself on his bed, but
could not sleep.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he went to visit the Premier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
his room, and was shocked to see how aged and
white and shaky Lord Penshurst looked.</p>

<p>Westerham cheered him as best he could, and
then, summoning Rookley, set out to look for Bagley,
the smug banker of Herne Hill.</p>

<p>They brought Bagley a prisoner back to Downing
Street, but in spite of every inducement
and every threat, he declared that he knew
nothing whatsoever of the whereabouts of Melun.</p>

<p>Half maddened with terror as to Kathleen's fate,
Westerham next turned his search in the direction
of the gaming house. But Melun had covered his
tracks well. The house was as silent and devoid
of any clue as had been the villa in St. John's
Wood. There was nothing to do but wait till night
and perfect the arrangements for the raid on
Limehouse.</p>

<p>The arrangements which Rookley made were
complete, and worked smoothly. So overwhelming
was the force of constables that surrounded the
house that resistance on the part of the members of
the crime club was rendered quite impossible.</p>

<p>In the little room in the front of the house Westerham
established a species of impromptu police-court.
One by one the members of the club were
brought in to him, and one by one they satisfied him
that they had no knowledge of Melun's whereabouts.</p>

<p>Still, Westerham had them safely kept under
lock and key. It was noon when this curious inquisition
was over, and then he immediately returned
to Downing Street and sought the Premier's
room.</p>

<p>As Westerham entered he looked up with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
smile which he fondly imagined was cheerful. His
words were gloomy enough, and to Westerham
seemed to have a certain amount of reproach in
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realise,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we have practically
only twenty-four hours left in which to find
Lady Kathleen and to recover the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham straightened himself up and looked
squarely at the Premier.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time is short,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;but I have
no fear that we shall not succeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must remember,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that up
to the present it is we who have made all the efforts.
What is Melun doing? It is very strange that he
should have remained quiet so long. It is my
opinion that he has put off communication until
the last possible moment in order to make his
claims all the more effective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think that is so?&#8221; cried Lord
Penshurst eagerly. &#8220;For my part, I was beginning
to fear that, despairing of being able to move us,
he had crossed to Germany in hopes of making
terms there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham shook his head in dissent at this view
of the question, though, as a matter of fact, he was
growing terribly anxious himself lest Melun
should after all have transferred his efforts to
Prussia.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he said to the Premier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> &#8220;I am perfectly
certain that he will turn up just in the nick
of time. Otherwise, why should he hold Lady
Kathleen as hostage for so long? You may, I
think, rest assured that he would not still be detaining
her if he had abandoned all hope of being
able to reduce us to surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p>The afternoon wore painfully away, and for the
first time Westerham learned how time can drag.
Up to the point at which he found himself completely
foiled in his search for Lady Kathleen he
had scarcely counted the hours or even the days.
Incident had been crowded on incident, and action
upon action.</p>

<p>But now that he found himself faced with the
necessity of waiting for the slightest sign that could
send him on the trail again, he had to meet and
endure the greatest trial that he had ever known.</p>

<p>It was such a helpless and almost hopeless position.
Still it was not without some hope, and hope
helped considerably to mitigate his sufferings between
the hours of noon and three o'clock.</p>

<p>And then, just as he had predicted&#8212;just as he
had calculated it must come to pass&#8212;the expected
message came. It came in the shape of a telegram
addressed to the Premier, which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;If you accept my terms, wire, not later than
four o'clock, to Smith-Brown-Smith, care of Poste
Restante, St Martin's-le-Grand. This is final.&#8212;M.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The receipt of this wire threw the Premier into
a state of great agitation, and he was for answering
it at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;The offer must be refused finally,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Don't you see, Sir Paul, that, after all that's been
said and done, I cannot possibly accept it? It is
not in my power to do so, and there appears to be
no way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he went on in a wailing voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> &#8220;no
man was ever in worse straits. It is a question of
my daughter or Armageddon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham restrained him, pointing out that in
such a matter as this an answer could not be
made on the spur of the moment. It was a
matter, he urged, that required considerable
thought.</p>

<p>Quietly and concisely he constructed in his own
mind a theory which accounted for the despatch
of the telegram, and, as he thought it over, he
became convinced that, in spite of its bold statement,
the telegram was unreliable. He became
certain that the offer which was made them was
by no means final.</p>

<p>He said as much to the Prime Minister, and explained
his reasons.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ridiculous to suppose,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;that
Melun is such a fool as to think that we shall agree
to his terms in this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, we have no assurance that
Lady Kathleen is to be restored to us even for a
time, and in the second place, Melun is not the type
of man to take anything on trust. Whatever risks
he may run in regard to Lady Kathleen he would
certainly not leave the handing over of the money
to chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Let us by all means send a reply to the
address he gives, but instead of accepting or not
accepting his terms let us word it in this way:
&#8216;Cannot accept any terms by wire. Make appointment
at which matters can be discussed. Will
guarantee your immunity from disagreeable consequences.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier clutched feverishly at this suggestion.
&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> &#8220;I see now that it
is the better way. Let's send the telegram at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the telegram was despatched, and Westerham
and the Premier sat down to wait again.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst had suggested that the post-office
should be watched in order that Smith-Brown-Smith
or his messenger might be watched and followed
home.</p>

<p>But Westerham argued against such a course,
pointing out that in broad daylight it would be
practically impossible for even the most astute of
followers to avoid the notice of the pursued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;that such a step would
be most unwise, and at the best we should only
succeed in arousing Melun's suspicions. And if he
thought we intended to try to catch him tripping,
it would merely drive him to extremes. Remember
that we have to consider not only Lady Kathleen's
safety, but the guarding of the secret. We must
not push Melun to the point of throwing him into
the arms of Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhat against his will, the Premier finally
gave in to this argument. For the next two hours
he sat with Westerham alert, anxious, and watchful.</p>

<p>Towards four o'clock the answer to the wire
came, but in a form so unlooked for and so terrible
that even Westerham was for a time unnerved.</p>

<p>It came not in the shape of a telegram, but in
the form of a small square cardboard box, neatly
wrapped in brown paper and addressed to the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>It was brought by a District Messenger boy,
who, in response to inquiries whence the package
came, could only say that it had been handed in
at the Oxford Street office by a gentleman of distinctly
foreign appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the parcel was addressed to Lord Penshurst,
Westerham took it from the attendant and
with his own hands laid it carefully and softly
down on the Premier's table.</p>

<p>For a moment Westerham looked reflectively
at the Prime Minister. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said slowly,
&#8220;if this parcel comes from Melun?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst was all eagerness. &#8220;Let's open
it at once and see,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But Westerham pushed the Prime Minister's
hands away from the package.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it alone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we don't know what
it may contain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst glanced at him sharply. &#8220;Good
Heavens!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you don't mean to tell me
that you think Melun would dare to send me a
bomb or something of that sort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One never knows,&#8221; said Westerham, thoughtfully.
&#8220;I think we had better send for Rookley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rookley came and surveyed the mysterious
package with a suspicious gaze. He picked it up
gently, and then almost smiled as he laid it down
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think you need fear its containing anything
in the nature of an explosive,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;certainly not an infernal machine. It is much
too light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham nodded, and without a word drew a
knife from his pocket and cut the string. Unfolding
the paper, he laid bare a brown cardboard box.</p>

<p>Both the Premier and Rookley were leaning
eagerly over Westerham's shoulders as he raised
the lid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the three men cried out together and stood
rigid as though frozen with horror.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst gave a second cry, and reeling
backwards would have fallen had not Westerham
caught him in his arms.</p>

<p>For lying on the top of a little pile of shavings
was a human ear. It was the small, round ear of
a woman, and against the blood-stained lobe
glittered a single diamond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; cried the Premier, turning away
his ashen face. &#8220;It's my daughter's!&#8221;</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class="smaller">WESTERHAM'S WAY OUT</span></a></h2>


<p>Lord Penshurst was beside himself with grief,
and clung to Westerham as a child might, weeping
passionately in his arms. Rookley, with a miserable
face, had slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>It was a quarter of an hour before Westerham
succeeded in bringing Lord Penshurst back to a
coherent frame of mind. Then he helped him to
his room, and left him dazed and piteous on his
bed.</p>

<p>Of the three men who had made the dread discovery
Westerham was perhaps the hardest hit,
but he walked back to the little box and its horrible
contents with set lips and grim face.</p>

<p>It was not, however, without a little shudder
that he lifted the lid and looked inside again. He
had anticipated that such an awful token would
not be sent unaccompanied by a message, and an
examination of the box proved his conjecture right.</p>

<p>Tucked into the lid was a crumpled piece of
paper. He smoothed it out carefully, and was then
able to read the following message:&#8212;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;This should be a sign that we are in earnest.
You will be given one more chance. Send to the
steps of St. Paul's Cathedral at nine o'clock to-night.
Man will meet you there, and things can be discussed.
Understand clearly that this man must
not be tampered with. His arrest will lead not
only to worse befalling Lady Kathleen, but to your
secret passing immediately to Germany. The same
results will follow if any attempt is made to buy
the man's assistance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Westerham read this message through three
times, until at last he could repeat every word of
it by heart. He folded it up, and placing it in his
waistcoat-pocket, shut the lid of the box and placed
it in a drawer of the Premier's writing-table.</p>

<p>Next he went back to Lord Penshurst's room,
which he entered without knocking. The broken
old man lay on the bed, his face buried in the
pillows, so entirely wrapped up in his grief that
he scarcely heeded the hand which Westerham
placed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>But presently Westerham persuaded him to look
up, and then drawing a chair to the bedside, he sat
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to forget, Lord Penshurst,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;what you saw just now. It is unnecessary to
remember it. It is a horrible thing, but the man
who did such an awful deed shall suffer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked away with a set face, which boded no
good for Melun when he found him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, however, one comfort to be extracted
from our distress,&#8221; he continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> &#8220;At last we
have a clue. The opportunity which I was certain
must come is in our hands now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before nine o'clock, however, there is much to
be done. You are scarcely able to take charge of
matters yourself, and you had better leave them to
me. I have already taken measures which ought
to prove effective, though we shall have to act very
carefully and cautiously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst dragged himself up into a sitting
posture and turned his blurred and scared old eyes
to Westerham's resolute face.</p>

<p>He clenched his fists and beat excitedly on the
coverlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't let that fiend escape! Oh! if I had the
strength I could kill him! I could kill him myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham did his best to soothe him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I shall let him
slip through my fingers this time. And Heaven
judge between us when I do meet him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier clutched at his hands in an appealing
and childish way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't spare him! Don't spare him!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's no fear of that,&#8221; said Westerham, and
he rose up to go.</p>

<p>When he regained the Prime Minister's study he
sent for a map of London, and for some minutes
studied it with close attention.</p>

<p>He guessed that a man who was risking so much
as the emissary appointed by Melun would take
good care to provide himself with sure and certain
means of escape. It was doubtful if he would trust
to the swiftness of his feet, to the chance of catching
a passing omnibus, or to losing himself in the
underground. In all likelihood, though he might
walk to the actual place of appointment, he would
probably drive to some neighbouring spot in a
motor-car.</p>

<p>It was upon this very reasonable assumption that
Westerham based his plans. The difficulty was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
as he knew full well, that a score of little streets
and alleys led into St. Paul's churchyard, and any
and all of these would be open to Melun's ambassador.</p>

<p>Westerham did his best to place himself in the
position of the man whom Melun was sending to
the cathedral steps. And arguing the matter out
from this point of view, he came to the conclusion
that he would drive to Queen Victoria Street or
Newgate Street by car, and then proceed to the
meeting-place on foot.</p>

<p>He ruled the junction of Newgate Street and
Cheapside out of court, as not offering sufficient
opportunities of shelter. That the man would choose
the point at which Queen Victoria Street ran into
Cannon Street was equally unlikely.</p>

<p>That left only one other route of escape&#8212;namely,
the open thoroughfare of Ludgate Hill.</p>

<p>This also Westerham set aside as being unnecessary
to consider. That any man should attempt
to escape down that broad street at a time of night
when it would be almost empty was too ridiculous
to contemplate.</p>

<p>He decided, therefore, that two motor-cars would
be sufficient for his purpose, and having ordered
them, he sent for Lowther and Mendip, to whom
he explained his plans.</p>

<p>He himself, he said, intended to go to St. Paul's
by omnibus, so as to reach the cathedral as nearly
as possible on the stroke of nine.</p>

<p>By that time Mendip was to be in waiting in
Queen Victoria Street, almost opposite the headquarters
of the Salvation Army.</p>

<p>Lowther he instructed to wait at the corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Angel Lane. For though the man might choose
one of the four alleys leading from the churchyard
up to Newgate Street, he must reach the main
thoroughfare either just to the east, or just to the
west, of Angel Lane.</p>

<p>Whether the man would be so bold as to adopt
either of the courses which Westerham decided
that he himself would choose was an open question.
It was a risk, however, which had to be taken, be
the consequences what they might.</p>

<p>Westerham saw that whatever line of country
the man might take at the close of the interview,
the task of following his steps would devolve upon
himself. He could trust no man on that mission,
though he saw that he would at the best make
but a poor shadower. His bulk was much against
him.</p>

<p>Sir Paul, however, had an alternative scheme in
mind should it fall out that the man discovered he
was followed. But of this he said nothing to the
others.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eight he set out eastwards,
travelling slowly by horse omnibus along the
Strand, down Fleet Street, and up Ludgate Hill.</p>

<p>He arrived at the appointed place a few minutes
before time, and, entering the tobacconist's shop
at the south-west corner of St. Paul's churchyard,
he purchased a cigar. This he lit slowly and
carefully, and afterwards made a pretence of
choosing a pipe. In this way he spent five minutes.</p>

<p>After five minutes he made his way out of the
shop, and, keeping well in the lee of the houses, he
edged his way to the corner of Dean's Yard. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
he drew back into the shadows, and while the clock
struck nine he watched the cathedral steps closely.</p>

<p>Three or four minutes passed before he observed
a man cross the road from the direction of Amen
Court, and, passing the statue of Queen Anne,
slowly mount the steps of St Paul's.</p>

<p>As he stood upon the steps, the man looked first
to the south and then to the westward down Ludgate
Hill. Finally he turned and closely examined
the shadows about the doorways of the drapers'
stores to the north.</p>

<p>No sooner was the man's back turned towards
him than Westerham shot out from the opening of
Dean's Yard, made a slight detour, and walked
boldly up towards the steps as if he had just hurried
up from Ludgate Hill.</p>

<p>Though he was certain in his own mind that the
man waiting on the steps was the messenger whom
he was eager to meet, he took the precaution of
showing not the slightest sign of curiosity as he
strolled towards him.</p>

<p>But as he came abreast of the man he saw that
this precaution was wholly unnecessary&#8212;for the
man who waited was Patmore!</p>

<p>Not by any means the Patmore whom he had
seen at the club in Limehouse and had good reason
to guess was one of Melun's close confederates.
But a different Patmore altogether!</p>

<p>His clothes were no longer rough and his hair
no longer tumbled. He was dressed in a frock-coat
and top-hat, and his whole appearance was
sleek and rather suggested the prosperous commercial
traveller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Patmore?&#8221; said Westerham, quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>Patmore started. &#8220;You've keen eyes, Sir Paul,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Westerham nodded. &#8220;I find it very necessary,&#8221;
he returned.</p>

<p>Without another word, Patmore took him by the
arm and led him higher up the steps. At the top
of them he turned and walked into the shadows
thrown by the columns which support the north
end of the façade.</p>

<p>Then he took one quick look about him, and
having satisfied himself that no one was within
earshot, came direct to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you agree?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>For answer Westerham took out his pocket-book
and counted out a pile of notes which Dunton had
secured for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said in a conversational voice, &#8220;are
twenty thousand pounds. They are yours if you
can tell me where to find Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore laughed scornfully. &#8220;I am afraid, Sir
Paul,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that on this occasion you have
made a mistake. Fifty times that sum would be a
little nearer my figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham stroked his chin thoughtfully and
fixed Patmore with his keen eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;even that might not
be too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shot a quick, keen glance at him, and
gave another little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but still I don't believe
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is rather foolish of you,&#8221; said Westerham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
&#8220;considering how little I ask. I don't want
to embroil you; I ask for nothing better than to be
told where I can find Lady Kathleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments the man seemed to be considering
the proposal. But finally he pushed the
notes with an impatient gesture of his hand towards
Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it's not worth the risk. The
other way the money's certain. You may be a mug,
but not such a mug as to pay over a cool million
for information of that sort. Besides, it can't be
done. The sum is too big, and what is more, as I
said just now, I don't trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham gathered the notes up and replaced
them in his pocket. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what
do you suggest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you ask me,&#8221; replied Patmore, &#8220;Melun's
making a fool of himself. He is crazy after the
girl, and he is crazy after cutting a fine figure in
society. He still insists upon having a quarter of
a million and a marriage with Lady Kathleen.
What's more, it's got to be settled to-night. You
hand over the dibs in the morning, and we will tell
you where the girl is in the afternoon. But no
hank! I tell you frankly again that I consider
Melun is a fool. He is prepared to take your word
for it that no questions shall be asked and that the
business goes no further. The question is whether
I am going to get your word?&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham knew well enough what his answer
must be, but he stood for some moments with his
eyes cast on the ground, as though he were weighing
the matter carefully.</p>

<p>At last he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> &#8220;It is impossible for me to
agree unless I can settle things personally with
Melun. You see, as the thing stands, I have no
guarantee at all that you have come from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore swore angrily. &#8220;You ought not to have
much doubt after this afternoon,&#8221; he said coarsely.</p>

<p>With the memory of Lady Kathleen's severed
ear fresh upon him, a sudden and passionate desire
to kill the man there and then, as he stood lowering
at him, arose in Westerham's heart. But he
forced his anger down, though his voice trembled
with rage as he said: &#8220;I think you had better be
careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore drew back a step; he saw he had gone
too far.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Westerham said:
&#8220;Very well. I suppose I have no option but to
agree. Where shall I meet you to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hardly likely to kick up a fuss,&#8221; Patmore
answered, eyeing him shrewdly, &#8220;so let's say
the same place at noon. Mind you, you had better
understand clearly that if you try to play me false
it will be all the worse for you and Lord Penshurst
and Lady Kathleen. We have made up our
minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you give me in charge, you cannot make me
open my mouth, and what is more you will finish
the whole business. If you play me false you will
never see Lady Kathleen again, and your secret
goes to Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham made a sudden movement forward
and looked into Patmore's face. &#8220;What is the
secret?&#8221; he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>For a moment Patmore looked scared, and then
he wagged his head wisely, and Westerham's heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
gave a great throb of relief, for he felt certain that
the man did not know. Melun had kept the secret
to himself.</p>

<p>Westerham drew away again and made to pass
down the steps. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will be
here at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Patmore was not satisfied, and hurrying
after him, plucked at his sleeve. &#8220;I have your
word?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Westerham turned on him fiercely. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
said through his teeth, &#8220;certainly not; I would
not take the word of a dog like you, and there is
no reason why I should give mine. You can take
what I say or leave it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments Patmore seemed doubtful.
Then he nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said sulkily.</p>

<p>Westerham walked briskly away, and made
across the street without turning his head. But as
he walked he drew from his pocket a little mirror,
which he had hidden in his handkerchief, and by
straining his eyes considerably he was able to see
that Patmore still stood in a hesitating way beneath
the monument of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>But as Westerham reached the pavement Patmore
moved away, and Westerham ran round the
heads of the horses of a waiting omnibus and there
stood still, sheltered behind a lamp-post in the
centre of the road.</p>

<p>Patmore had reached the pavement opposite the
Church House, and had turned up a little court
between the two drapers' shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>He disappeared from view, and Westerham,
crossing the street, hid in the doorway of the
jeweller's at the corner. Craning his neck, he
could see Patmore hurrying towards Amen Court.</p>

<p>Then Westerham took a big risk. He dashed
up Paternoster Row and turned up to the left. He
ran straight ahead until he reached Cheapside and
saw that Lowther's car was in waiting. It was a
big car with a limousine body, and Westerham,
plunging in, pulled down the window at Lowther's
back and spoke rapidly to him. &#8220;Go on for twenty
yards,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then turn, and just crawl down
the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham had run as he had never run before,
and was slightly out of breath; he knew he must
have beaten Patmore by a good many yards, and as
there was no car in sight he thought he might have
to follow him when he marched into Newgate
Street.</p>

<p>But just as he had calculated he would, Patmore
came hastily into the main thoroughfare and
glanced up and down. He gave one quick look at
the motor as it moved slowly westward. Lowther,
to excuse the slowness of his pace, was seemingly
having great trouble with a clutch.</p>

<p>A motor-omnibus rattled past them, and on this
Patmore climbed.</p>

<p>This complicated matters considerably. It would
have been comparatively a simple matter to follow
a motor-car, but to hang behind a motor-omnibus
in such a way that they could, without being
noticed themselves, see if Patmore left it, was a
more difficult piece of work altogether.</p>

<p>Their anxiety was considerably lessened when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the motor-car drew up at the further end of Holborn
viaduct. They saw Patmore leave it and
jump into a waiting taxicab.</p>

<p>The taxicab shot straight ahead up Holborn,
and from the fact that Patmore had not troubled
to look about him Westerham judged that he was
not anticipating pursuit.</p>

<p>The taxicab, which they kept well in view, ran
quickly through Oxford Circus and on to Orchard
Street; there it turned north, and they followed it
as closely as they dared past Baker Street to St.
John's Wood Chapel.</p>

<p>As it shot ahead up the Finchley Road, Westerham
wondered whether Patmore was making for
Mme. Estelle's. He decided, however, that this
could scarcely be, as he had taken the precaution
of having the house closely watched throughout the
day, and up to the time he left Downing Street
there had been no report as to the return of any of
its wonted inmates.</p>

<p>Soon, too, it became apparent that Laburnum
Road was not the goal. The taxicab rushed past
Swiss Cottage and on to Finchley. Here it
branched off to the north, and finally turned up a
newly laid-out road.</p>

<p>Westerham called to Lowther to pull up at the
corner, as he knew their destination must now be
in sight.</p>

<p>So certain was Westerham that they were now
nearing the goal that he left the car and walked
on foot to the corner of the road. Just as he imagined
would be the case, the taxicab had drawn
up outside a neat, brand-new, red-bricked villa.</p>

<p>He dodged round the corner again, and hastily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
lifted the car's bonnet. He called on Lowther to
get down, and together the two men began to examine
a sparking plug with wholly fictitious energy.
The returning taxicab passed them at a good pace,
the driver paying no heed either to them or to the
car.</p>

<p>Westerham took a deep breath and withdrew his
head from the covering bonnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Lowther,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I fancy that
the last act is about to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he added more to himself than to
his companion, &#8220;whether Lady Kathleen is here?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he paused at the gate he clapped his hand to
Lowther's hip-pocket and nodded with approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loaded?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Lowther nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you may need it, but we
will go quietly to start with. I am going in first.
If I don't appear in five minutes come in after me,
and don't stick at trifles. I may want you before
then, and if I do I will give a sharp whistle,
so&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>He rehearsed the whistle under his breath.</p>

<p>Lowther signified his understanding, and stepped
back into the shade of one of the brick pillars of the
gate as Westerham swung into the garden and ran
quickly on silent feet up the steps.</p>

<p>He fumbled for a few moments in the darkness
till he found the electric bell. This he pushed,
purposely giving the same number of rings which
he had heard Melun give knocks on the door at
Limehouse.</p>

<p>There was a light in the dining-room window,
and a few minutes later the door was quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
opened. Westerham put his foot against it and
squeezed inside. The hall was dimly lit, but there
was sufficient light to see Patmore's face go white
as he realised that he had been fooled.</p>

<p>In a moment Westerham had him pinned against
the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't cry out,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;or it will be
the worse for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his great strength he pinned Patmore's
flabby arms to his side and ran him through the
door on the right, which stood open.</p>

<p>Still holding Patmore in his grip, he kicked the
door to and thrust him down into a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me where Lady Kathleen is?&#8221; he said in
a low, fierce whisper.</p>

<p>Patmore remained silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Westerham again, &#8220;and tell me
quickly. Tell me at once or you will regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore gave a sudden wrench and twisted one
of his arms free. He reached out and grasped a
heavy silver candlestick.</p>

<p>But again Westerham was too quick for him.
He dealt him a blow on the muscles of his shoulder
which half-paralysed Patmore's arm. The candlestick
dropped with a clatter from his hand.</p>

<p>Westerham gave his pent-up passion full play,
and it was a miracle that he did not kill his man.
He dragged an antimacassar from a chair and used
it as a gag. With one powerful hand he dragged
Patmore by the neck to the window; with the other
he threw up the casement and whistled sharply for
Lowther.</p>

<p>Lowther came running up the steps and through
the open door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We'll bind this cur,&#8221; said Westerham through
his teeth. And they fastened his hands and his
feet together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Westerham to Lowther, &#8220;heat
that poker in the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a second Lowther hesitated to obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I tell you,&#8221; whispered Westerham, and
his face was the face of a madman.</p>

<p>Lowther thrust the poker between the bars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lowther found a syphon of soda-water and
brought Patmore to by squirting his face; then
Westerham lifted the man up as though he were a
child and threw him into the car. Lowther climbed
to the steering wheel and headed south for Kent.</p>

<p>Westerham knew where Lady Kathleen was held
prisoner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class="smaller">THE LAST FIGHT</span></a></h2>


<p>As the car ran southwards and came to Oxford
Street, Westerham thrust Patmore on to the floor
and sat holding him between his knees.</p>

<p>Without pity, he again seized the shrinking man's
neck in his great hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Understand,&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;that if
you attempt to cry out you will be strangled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patmore made a choking noise to indicate that
he understood, and the car went on at a great pace
through Regent Street across Piccadilly, and so
reached Whitehall.</p>

<p>Westerham had decided that, apart from the
necessity of giving Lord Penshurst the good news,
it would be better to take the Premier with them
to the farm in Kent at which Westerham had
learned Kathleen was imprisoned.</p>

<p>It was close on midnight when Lowther brought
the car to a standstill in Downing Street. Mendip,
who had abandoned his obviously futile watching
in Queen Victoria Street, had returned some time
before, and now rushed out to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's inside,&#8221; said Lowther, jerking his head
back, and Mendip thrust his head through the window
peering into the gloom in search of Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all right,&#8221; said Westerham, quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
&#8220;Don't rouse anybody, but get Lord Penshurst out
here at once. I have got a man in here with me
and my hands are full.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave Patmore's back a by no means tender
squeeze as a further indication that he had no intention
of relinquishing his grip.</p>

<p>Mendip ran inside, and finding the Premier,
brought him to the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said eagerly, &#8220;have you news at
last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Westerham. &#8220;I have discovered
Lady Kathleen's whereabouts, and I think we
shall be just in time. But we must start at once,
and you had better come with us. Mendip, get
Lord Penshurst a hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were off again in a few minutes, Mendip
riding beside Lowther, and the Premier beside Westerham
in the body of the car.</p>

<p>He inquired eagerly as to the man whom Westerham
still held between his knees, and Westerham,
to Patmore's shame, briefly outlined what
had passed since he had kept the appointment at
St. Paul's.</p>

<p>There were some things which he did not tell the
Premier, and Patmore, wincing under yet another
squeeze from Westerham's ruthless fingers, held
his peace.</p>

<p>The man had given them fairly accurate directions
as to the road which they must take, and
Lowther made good speed through New Cross and
so to Bromley. They kept on down the main road
till they passed Farnborough, where, in accordance
with Patmore's instructions, he branched off
to the left, and leaving Cudham behind them, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
swept down the hill to Westerham, the place from
which Sir Paul took his name.</p>

<p>They were now, indeed, travelling along the same
route which Melun had taken when he had kidnapped
Lady Kathleen in Richmond Park.</p>

<p>As they ran through Sevenoaks Westerham lowered
the windows and made Patmore kneel on the
front of the seat, so that he could the better point
out the way to Lowther.</p>

<p>Lowther knew the district fairly well, and
whistled to himself as Patmore directed him to turn
up to the right before they reached Hildenborough.</p>

<p>The car was now heading for Edenbridge, and
he knew they were racing along the foot of that
great range of hills, the southern slopes of which
are almost as precipitous and desolate as the moors
of Devon.</p>

<p>Before long Patmore directed Lowther to turn
to the right again, and he had to put the car on to
her second and then on to her third speed as the hill
rose up almost sheer before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much further is it?&#8221; he asked over his
shoulder as the engines of the motor complained
bitterly at the ascent.</p>

<p>&#8220;About another half-mile. Then you get on to
a sort of plateau. There you must turn to the left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far will the turning be from the house?&#8221;
asked Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not sure,&#8221; replied Patmore, &#8220;but I should
think about five hundred yards. You will have to
drive through what is practically a bridle-path and
take it gently. It is an awkward place on a dark
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was in considerable pain as the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of the treatment he had met with at Finchley, and
now and again he groaned so pitifully that at last
Westerham let him slide down from the seat on to
the floor of the car again.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst asked what ailed him. And Patmore
would have spoken had not Westerham dug
his fingers into his ribs. Patmore knew well enough
what that dig in his ribs meant, and wisely kept
silent.</p>

<p>As the car groaned and snorted her way up the
hill Westerham took counsel with himself. He was
doubtful as to the wisdom of running up to the
door, lest the noise of the car's approach should
give Melun and the other inmates of the farm
warning of their approach. He reflected, however,
that the warning would be very slight, and that, for
all he could tell, every moment might count. So
he held on, and as they turned into the bridle-path
he urged Lowther to use all the speed he dared.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark beneath the trees, and Westerham
sitting in the blackness of the body of the
car, could hear light boughs and sometimes heavy
branches scrape along the sides.</p>

<p>Suddenly the car stopped and, looking out of the
window, Westerham, whose eyes were used to the
darkest night, could discern that they were in a
little clearing.</p>

<p>He jumped out and, turning round, he took out
a spare revolver which he had brought with him
and placed it in Lord Penshurst's hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst,&#8221; Westerham said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> &#8220;it is necessary
for someone to keep an eye on this man. I
have no idea how many of Melun's gang may be
waiting for us. I am told probably not more than
two; but one cannot take anything of that sort on
trust, and to avoid all unnecessary risks I shall
want Mendip and Lowther with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier, whom the drive and the near approach
of danger had rendered alert and almost
cheerful, nodded at Westerham in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, and his gnarled but still
sinewy hand took a firm grip on Patmore's collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better sit still,&#8221; he said, and Patmore
cringed at the Premier's knees. His spirit was entirely
broken by the agony he was now enduring.</p>

<p>The ray from one of the lamps outlined the shape
of a gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; cried Westerham in a low voice,
and in a second he had jumped forward and pulled
the iron catch back and taken a stride forward.
But his eager foot found no foothold. His hand
was torn from its grasp of the gate, and he pitched
forward, to find himself plunged up to the neck in
icy water.</p>

<p>So great was the shock that he cried out a little
as he spluttered and blew the water from his mouth.
A couple of strokes brought him back to the gate
again, and as he clutched it he looked up at the
silent house.</p>

<p>Even as he did so he caught a little spit of flame
from one of the windows and a bullet splashed into
the water beside his head. There was another spit
of flame, and he felt his knuckles tingle as though
they had been rapped with a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>Then Mendip gripped him by the collar, and with
his aid he scrambled up on to the path.</p>

<p>Lowther, who had been quick to see the necessity
of instant action, was by this time firing back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the place from which the little spits of flame had
come far above them. In the darkness he answered
shot for shot.</p>

<p>After the sound of the shots came a complete
silence, and Westerham, as he stood stock-still beside
the gate, which was now swinging idly over
the pond, could hear the patter of the water on the
path as it dripped from his clothes.</p>

<p>Mendip, as soon as he had seen that Westerham
was safe, had run along the hedge, and now he gave
a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the gate we want,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>But a third spit of flame came from the darkness
overhead, and Westerham heard Mendip swearing
softly under his breath. Whoever their unknown
assailant might be, he was no mean marksman.</p>

<p>Westerham and Lowther ran to Mendip's aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's up?&#8221; asked Westerham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered Mendip, and he got the
gate opened. The three men dashed up the path
and reached the door of the farmhouse; but it was
made of stout oak, and securely fastened within.</p>

<p>They thrust their shoulders against it without
avail, and then stood looking at one another, panting,
and for the moment baffled.</p>

<p>It was then that Westerham's quick ear caught
a woman's voice. He whipped round and looked
across the sheet of water. His eyes were now well
accustomed to the gloom, and he saw the form of
a woman leaning far out of a window and gesticulating
wildly.</p>

<p>He held up his hand to the others for silence, and
then once more came a voice which he instantly
recognised. It was the voice of Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Be quick! Be quick!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;If you
don't wish to be too late, you must swim the pond,
the door is barred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham cast a quick glance behind him, and
his eyes fell on the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use that as a battering ram,&#8221; he ordered, and
then his jaws closed over the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>Without hesitation he waded in, and a few
strong strokes brought him beneath the window out
of which Mme. Estelle leant and waved.</p>

<p>He knew instinctively by her accents that she
was terrified beyond measure and that he need not
expect treachery from her.</p>

<p>With one hand he clutched the sill, with the other
he reached up and shifting the safety-cap on with
his thumb, let his revolver fall into the room.</p>

<p>Soaked as he was with water, it was not an easy
task to hoist himself up and clamber through the
window, and when at last he stood within the room
he leant against the wall partially exhausted and
breathing hard.</p>

<p>Mme. Estelle stood before him wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quick!&#8221; she said again. &#8220;Be quick! be
quick! or you will be too late. That fiend Melun
is at his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the light of the candles which flickered on the
mantelpiece Westerham made his way to the door.</p>

<p>Seizing the handle, he turned it, but the lock held
fast. He examined it swiftly, and to his joy saw
that it opened outwards. He drew back a yard,
and then sent the whole of his great weight crashing
against the panels. And with good fortune the
door of the room, although stoutly built, was partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
rotten. It burst wide open before his weight
and sent him sprawling on to his face in the passage.</p>

<p>As he lay there half-stunned his pulses throbbed
again as the noise which came from the main entrance
told him that Lowther and Mendip were
making good use of the gate.</p>

<p>He dragged himself up to his knees, still clutching
his revolver, and at the same moment the outer
door gave up its resistance, and Lowther and Mendip
came headlong into the hall-way.</p>

<p>He heard them give a warning shout as he
struggled to his feet, steadying himself by the pillars
of the banisters.</p>

<p>Looking up the stairs, he saw the brutal face of
Crow on the landing, his strong, yellow teeth bared
in a vicious snarl.</p>

<p>Westerham heard the sound of a shot, and at the
same time felt the hands of Mme. Estelle give him
a push.</p>

<p>Her intention was unselfish, almost heroic; she
saved Westerham's life, but lost her own.</p>

<p>She pitched forward with a little gasping sigh
and lay still, huddled on the stairs. Westerham
heard a second shot rap out from behind his back,
and saw Crow stagger on the landing. The
man reeled for a couple of paces and then fell
heavily.</p>

<p>Westerham had by this time fully got back his
senses and his breath; and now he heard coming
from somewhere high above him scream after
scream of dreadful terror.</p>

<p>He plunged up the staircase, and stepping across
the body of Crow as it lay on the landing, raced up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the second flight of stairs. For a moment he
paused, in order to make doubly sure whence the
dreadful screaming came.</p>

<p>Then he had no doubt, and dashed on, up to the
third flight, till he came to the topmost landing.</p>

<p>Here he was confronted by a door, and he
groaned within himself. He was living in some
awful nightmare at which a door faced him at every
turn.</p>

<p>He emptied his revolver in the lock and hurled
himself in frenzy against this further obstruction;
it gave way, and he tottered into the room, the
lights of which for a moment dazzled him.</p>

<p>His half-blinded eyes were greeted by the sight
which he had dreaded ever since he had come to
the farm on the hill.</p>

<p>Kathleen was fighting desperately, and for life,
with Melun.</p>

<p>With a great cry Westerham leapt forward, but
he was too late to exercise that vengeance which
had now full possession of his soul.</p>

<p>Melun flung Kathleen to one side, and for a second
turned his pallid face, in which his eyes were
burning like a madman's, full on Westerham as
he dashed on him.</p>

<p>Then without a sound he leapt aside, and vaulting
on to the sill of the open window, jumped out.</p>

<p>Instinctively Westerham knew what was coming,
and catching Kathleen to him, held her head against
his breast, stopping her ears with his hands. As
his palms closed upon them his heart grew sick as
he remembered the dreadful thing which had come
to Downing Street earlier in the day.</p>

<p>But to his unutterable joy&#8212;joy which was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
a shock&#8212;his hands told him that Melun's hideous
warning had been but a brutal hoax.</p>

<p>Kathleen was never told of it.</p>

<p>Then as he stood there with his eyes bent on her
hair, he heard the sickening sound of Melun's body
thud on to the stones below.</p>

<p>Releasing Kathleen's ears, he put his hand under
her chin and lifted up her face. He marvelled that
she had not fainted, but the dreadful horror in her
eyes struck into his heart like a blow.</p>

<p>He had to hold her to prevent her falling to the
floor, and so he stood for some few seconds with
Kathleen limp and shivering in his arms.</p>

<p>Bracing himself for one last effort, Westerham
lifted Kathleen up and bore her out of the room.
Half-dazed, he stumbled down the stairs with her
until he reached the hall.</p>

<p>In the doorway he saw Lord Penshurst, still
clinging grimly to Patmore's collar, but at the sight
of Kathleen the Premier released his hold and
came running forward with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute,&#8221; said Westerham, quickly, and
he walked into the room, the door of which he had
shattered.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mendip and Lowther had picked
up Mme. Estelle and carried her into the same
room, and now she lay on the couch, her face growing
grey with the shadows of death, and her breath
coming fast and feebly. Her eyes stared up at the
ceiling with an intense and horrible fixity.</p>

<p>Westerham pushed an armchair round with his
foot and set Kathleen down on it so that her back
was turned to the dying woman.</p>

<p>Lord Penshurst fell on his knees beside the chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and seizing his daughter's hands, held them against
his breast, and for a little while wept quietly.</p>

<p>Westerham crossed over to Mme. Estelle and
stood over her. He put his hand against her heart
and listened to her breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; he said in a low voice to Mendip,
&#8220;that we can do nothing for her. It is a bad
business. Heaven forgive her for anything
she has done amiss! She did her best to make
amends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drew Lowther out of the room and told
him to fetch a lamp from the car. Patmore was
sitting on the stairs with his face hidden in his
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind him,&#8221; said Westerham, as Lowther
gave the man a glance, &#8220;we shall have no
more trouble from that quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Lowther had fetched the lamp Westerham
took it and began rapidly to examine round
the ground floor of the rambling building. He was
seeking for the courtyard into which Melun had
fallen.</p>

<p>At last they found it, and found, too, all that remained
of Melun. He was battered and crushed
and bruised almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Westerham set his face and straightened the
twisted and distorted body out. Then began the
grim task of searching the dead man's clothes. He
turned out every pocket, and with a knife ripped
open every lining. But the papers which he sought
were not there.</p>

<p>He straightened himself, and picking up the lamp
led the way back into the house.</p>

<p>By this time Kathleen, though very pale and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
shaken, was quite composed. Indeed, she was now
more self-possessed than the Premier. She was
doing her utmost to quiet his still painful agitation.</p>

<p>Westerham looked into Kathleen's face, and seeing
how strong and resolute it was, felt no hesitation
in speaking before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Penshurst,&#8221; he said, very quietly, &#8220;Melun
is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Premier glanced at him quickly and then
turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank heaven!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; said Kathleen, gently, and taking her
father by the arm she pointed to Mme. Estelle.</p>

<p>Mendip had done what he could, and the unhappy
woman had, to some extent, come back to consciousness.</p>

<p>She was indeed sufficiently alive to catch Westerham's
words. She brought her fast fading eyes
down from the ceiling and searched Westerham's
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melun!&#8221; she muttered to herself: &#8220;Melun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham drew near and knelt down by the
couch. He took one of her hands, which was even
then growing cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melun?&#8221; she asked again in a voice scarcely
above a whisper.</p>

<p>Westerham put his mouth down to her ear and
said slowly, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shock of the news acted on the woman in a
most extraordinary way. With a convulsive movement
she suddenly gathered herself together and
sat bolt upright on the couch. She would have
fallen back again had not Westerham caught her
in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The papers!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Westerham, kindly and soothingly.
&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a faint movement she pointed towards
Westerham's feet. &#8220;There!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>To Westerham it seemed as if she were already
beginning to wander in her mind, but he said still
kindly and soothingly, &#8220;Yes, yes, I know! But
where?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman opened her mouth and made two or
three efforts before she spoke again, and then she
only breathed the word &#8220;Boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham's gaze wandered over the sideboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if you can find any brandy,&#8221; he said to
Mendip.</p>

<p>Mendip could find no brandy, but brought some
almost neat whisky over in a glass.</p>

<p>Westerham took the glass from Mendip's hand
and pressed it to Mme. Estelle's lips. She revived
a little, and suddenly spoke clearly and in almost
her normal voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Paul,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the papers are in your
boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Westerham stared into the dying
woman's face, under the impression that her reason
had departed from her. But with a start he remembered
how he had awoke in St. John's Wood,
after being drugged, to find himself dressed in
strange clothes and in new footgear. And for the
first time the real significance of the removal of all
his apparel from his rooms in Bruton Street struck
him with full force. He remembered, too, that
from the night he had left Mme. Estelle, Melun, by
one swift action after another, had kept him constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
on the move, so that it had been impossible
for him so much as to order fresh clothes.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of Lord Penshurst and
Kathleen, and to the wonderment of Lowther and
Mendip, Westerham propped Mme. Estelle up
against the pillows and began rapidly to remove his
boots.</p>

<p>Comfortable though they had been, it had always
struck him that they were unnaturally deep between
the outer and the inner sole. The meaning
of that came clearly home to him now.</p>

<p>No sooner had he pulled off his boots than he
took a knife and began to rip feverishly at the
heels. He succeeded in detaching them, and was
then able easily to rip open the soles.</p>

<p>He was now fully prepared for any turn of
events, but he could not repress an exclamation, as
in tearing away the upper layers of leather, his eyes
fell on a dozen neatly-folded sheets of tissue
paper.</p>

<p>He drew them out, and with a cry Lord Penshurst
snatched them from his hand.</p>

<p>Westerham saw at a glance that the Premier had
regained the papers he had lost&#8212;the papers which
had jeopardised, not only the peace of nations, but
his own and his daughter's honour.</p>

<p>Westerham seized the other boot, but Mme. Estelle
shook her head. &#8220;Look afterwards,&#8221; she
gasped, &#8220;not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham held the whisky to her lips again,
and again she rallied slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers,&#8221; she said faintly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> &#8220;were deposited
at the poste-restante, St. Martin's-le-Grand, in my
name. But Melun really thought you had discovered
where they were and took them away. There
was not a single place in which we could hope to
hide them safely. It was I who thought of your
boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it,&#8221; she said, with a wan little smile at
Westerham, &#8220;partly to save you. I knew that so
long as you were safe the papers were safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melun was so certain that he would win,&#8221; she
went on wearily, &#8220;I don't think he really thought
of doing you any injury. It struck him that it
would be an immense joke after he had got his way
to tell Lord Penshurst that the man who was trying
to find the papers had them in his possession
all the time. I think sometimes he was mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame paused, and her eyes contracted as
though with pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive!&#8221; she gasped. Then her eyes became
fixed and staring.</p>

<p>It was Westerham who drew the dead woman's
eyelids down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was long past dawn when they reached Downing
Street, and Lord Penshurst at once sent in cipher
a short message to the Czar, informing his
Majesty of the recovery of the papers.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the Premier's own room, Westerham
sat for a short while with Kathleen and Lord
Penshurst. But little was said, for, just as some
sorrows are too deep for tears, so there is some
gratitude beyond thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Westerham,&#8221; said the Premier, earnestly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> &#8220;it
is simply impossible that I shall ever be able to repay
you the great service you have rendered me.
But, believe me, if there is anything in the world
it is within my power to give you, you have but to
ask to receive it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Westerham looked across at Kathleen, but said
nothing. The time had not yet come when he could
ask Lord Penshurst for that which would a thousand
times repay him.</p>
